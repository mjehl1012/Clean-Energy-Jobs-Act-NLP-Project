Effective immediately.\\nLRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\nFISCAL NOTE ACT\\nMAY APPLY\\nA BILL FORHB0804 LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 AN ACT concerning regulation.\\n2 Be it enacted by the People of the State of Illinois,\\n3 represented in the General Assembly:\\n4 Article 1. Findings\\n5 Section 1-5. Findings. The General Assembly finds that:\\n6 (a) The growing clean energy economy in Illinois can be a\\n7 vehicle for expanding equitable access to public health,\\n8 safety, a cleaner environment, quality jobs, economic\\n9 opportunity, and wealth-building, particularly in economically\\n10 disadvantaged communities and communities of black,\\n11 indigenous, and people of color that have had to bear the\\n12 disproportionate burden of dirty fossil fuel pollution.\\n13 (b) Placing Illinois on a path to 100% renewable energy is\\n14 vital to a clean energy future. To bring this vision to\\n15 fruition, our energy policy must prioritize a just transition\\n16 that incentivizes renewable development and other\\n17 carbon-reducing policies, such as energy efficiency,\\n18 beneficial electrification, and peak demand reduction, while\\n19 ensuring that the benefits and opportunities of a carbon-free\\n20 future are accessible in economically disadvantaged\\n21 communities, environmental justice communities, and\\n22 communities of black, indigenous, and people of color.\\n23 (c) In the wake of federal reversals on climate action,HB0804 - 2 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the State of Illinois should pursue immediate action on\\n2 policies that will ensure a just and responsible phase out of\\n3 fossil fuels from the power sector to reduce harmful emissions\\n4 from Illinois power plants, support power plant communities\\n5 and workers, and allow the clean energy economy to continue\\n6 growing in every corner of Illinois.\\n7 (d) Energy efficiency should form the basis of any robust\\n8 clean energy policy. It is the cheapest clean energy resource,\\n9 and efficiency upgrades help customers manage their energy\\n10 bills directly by reducing the energy they need, and\\n11 indirectly by holding demand and prices down statewide.\\n12 (e) The transportation sector is now the leading source of\\n13 carbon pollution in Illinois, responsible for roughly\\n14 one-third of all carbon emissions. The State of Illinois\\n15 should set forth an ambitious goal to remove the equivalent of\\n16 more than 1,000,000 gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles from\\n17 our roads by quickly implementing new policies that expand\\n18 access to transit, promote walking and biking mobility, and\\n19 increase electric vehicle adoption. If managed appropriately,\\n20 electric vehicle adoption will drastically reduce emissions\\n21 from transportation, and could save Illinois residents\\n22 billions of dollars.\\n23 (f) In addition to better air quality and a safer climate,\\n24 Illinois residents who do not use electric vehicles also\\n25 benefit from greater adoption through lower electric bills\\n26 resulting from the greater use of the electric grid duringHB0804 - 3 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 off-peak hours.\\n2 (g) The State of Illinois should set forth an ambitious\\n3 goal to transition all vehicle fleets operated by or on behalf\\n4 of public agencies to full electric power. The transition to\\n5 zero-emission fleets should be leveraged to promote increased\\n6 investment in domestic manufacturing capacity within the\\n7 emerging electric vehicle industry. The resulting new,\\n8 high-skilled production jobs can also provide pathways into\\n9 the middle class for racially, economically, and\\n10 geographically marginalized communities. When procuring\\n11 electric vehicles, public agencies shall use high-road\\n12 economic development standards, like the U.S. Employment Plan.\\n13 By using the U.S. Employment Plan or a Local Employment Plan,\\n14 public agencies will incentivize electric vehicle companies to\\n15 create and retain high-skilled manufacturing jobs with living\\n16 wages and benefits; invest in domestic manufacturing\\n17 facilities; and propose plans to recruit, train, and hire\\n18 workers who face structural barriers to family-sustaining jobs\\n19 and career pathways.\\n20 (h) Energy storage, such as batteries, can provide many\\n21 services to the electricity grid that benefit the grid,\\n22 including managing (or shaving) peak load, frequency\\n23 regulation, voltage support, reserve capacity, and black-start\\n24 capability. If that storage facilitates greater use of\\n25 renewables, it can allow for more clean energy to be\\n26 accessible, reduce pollution, and provide multiple benefits.HB0804 - 4 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (i) Illinois needs to adopt a broad-based policy approach\\n2 to decarbonize Illinois\\' electric sector (including\\n3 electricity production and consumption) in a just and\\n4 equitable manner that puts our State on track to phase out\\n5 carbon dioxide emitting power plants by 2030.\\n6 (j) Illinois\\' policy approach must ensure the reduction of\\n7 co-pollutant emissions that cause serious local health\\n8 impacts, prioritizing environmental justice communities near\\n9 power plants.\\n10 (k) As we decarbonize Illinois\\' electric sector, Illinois\\n11 must create new investment to stimulate the economic and\\n12 environmental well-being of communities disproportionately\\n13 impacted by the historical operation of, and recent or\\n14 expected closures of, fossil fuel power plants and coal mining\\n15 operations.\\n16 (l) On January 23, 2019, Governor Pritzker signed an\\n17 executive order committing Illinois as a signatory to the U.S.\\n18 Climate Alliance to reduce state-based greenhouse gas\\n19 emissions consistent with the 2015 Paris Agreement. This\\n20 commitment identifies natural and working lands as a principal\\n21 initiative to meet the associated carbon emissions reduction\\n22 targets for Illinois. As Illinois works to reduce carbon\\n23 emissions from the power generation and transportation\\n24 sectors, Illinois can also lead the nation in recognizing the\\n25 benefits of nature as a tool to both mitigate and adapt to\\n26 climate change.HB0804 - 5 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Article 5. Clean Jobs, Workforce and Contractor Equity Act\\n2 Part 1. Governance\\n3 Section 5-101. Short title. This Article may be cited as\\n4 the Clean Jobs, Workforce and Contractor Equity Act.\\n5 Section 5-105. Findings.\\n6 (a) The General Assembly finds that the clean energy jobs\\n7 sector, including renewables, energy efficiency, energy\\n8 storage, and other related fields, is a growing sector in the\\n9 State of Illinois and that programs to support a growing\\n10 workforce and robust businesses in this sector would benefit\\n11 from a centralized structure for community input and oversight\\n12 and regional program administration to reduce costs, support\\n13 knowledge sharing, and facilitate access to the programs.\\n14 (b) The General Assembly finds that the State of Illinois\\n15 should build upon the success of the Future Energy Jobs Act and\\n16 the Illinois Solar for All program by further expanding\\n17 statewide equitable access to quality training, jobs, and\\n18 economic opportunities across the entire clean energy sector\\n19 in and throughout Illinois, including solar, wind, energy\\n20 efficiency, transportation electrification, and other related\\n21 clean energy industries, especially for members of the\\n22 following communities across the State to enter and completeHB0804 - 6 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the career pipeline for clean energy jobs, with the goal of\\n2 serving all of the following groups distributed across the\\n3 network: (i) low-income persons and families; (ii) persons\\n4 residing in environmental justice communities; (iii) BIPOC\\n5 persons; (iv) justice-involved persons; (v) persons who are or\\n6 were in the child welfare system; (vi) energy workers; (vii)\\n7 members of any of these groups who are also women,\\n8 transgender, or gender nonconforming persons; and (viii)\\n9 members of any of these groups who are also youth, especially\\n10 those who have had to bear the disproportionate burden of\\n11 dirty fossil fuel pollution. The General Assembly further\\n12 finds that the programs included in the Clean Jobs, Workforce\\n13 and Contractor Equity Act are essential to equitable,\\n14 statewide access to quality training, jobs, and economic\\n15 opportunities across the clean energy sector.\\n16 (c) The General Assembly finds that the State of Illinois\\n17 should build upon the success of the Future Energy Jobs Act and\\n18 the Illinois Solar for All program by ensuring small, BIPOC\\n19 clean energy businesses and contractors have equitable access\\n20 to economic opportunities, including new clean energy jobs and\\n21 investment created by the growing clean energy sector in\\n22 Illinois.\\n23 (d) The General Assembly finds that serious challenges are\\n24 posed for Illinois small business owners due to income and\\n25 wealth disparities, that market barriers disproportionately\\n26 impact BIPOC contractors and small business owners, obtainingHB0804 - 7 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 certifications and program qualifications are an essential\\n2 part of doing business in the clean energy economy and that\\n3 discriminatory lending policies limit these businesses\\' access\\n4 to capital.\\n5 (1) This finding is informed by a July 2020 analysis\\n6 of 2018 U.S. Census American Community Survey data by the\\n7 Center for American Progress which found that \"while Black\\n8 Americans make up 13 percent of the U.S. population, they\\n9 own less than 2 percent of small businesses with\\n10 employees. By contrast, white Americans make up 60 percent\\n11 of the U.S. population but own 82 percent of small\\n12 employer firms. If Black Americans enjoyed the same\\n13 business ownership and success rates as their white\\n14 counterparts, there would be approximately 860,000\\n15 additional Black-owned firms employing more than 10\\n16 million people.\" (A Blueprint for Revamping the Minority\\n17 Business Development Agency, Center for American Progress\\n18 July 31, 2020).\\n19 (2) This finding is also informed by the Federal\\n20 Reserve Bank of Atlanta\\'s December 2019 Small Business\\n21 Credit Survey which examined and found disparities in\\n22 reliance on personal funds/credit scores, loan application\\n23 outcomes, reliance on higher cost and lower transparency\\n24 credit products, loan approval rates and lender\\n25 satisfaction. The survey concluded \"Minority-owned firms\\n26 more frequently reported financial challenges.HB0804 - 8 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Seventy-eight percent of Black-owned firms, and 69% of\\n2 Asian- and Hispanic-owned firms did so, compared to 62% of\\n3 White-owned businesses.\" (Small Business Credit Survey\\n4 2019 Report on Minority-Owned Firms, Federal Reserve Bank\\n5 of Atlanta, December 2019).\\n6 (3) The General Assembly further finds that these\\n7 disparities continue as businesses develop. This finding\\n8 is informed by a December 2016 Stanford Institute for\\n9 Economic Policy Research study that concluded \"We find\\n10 that African-American business ventures start smaller in\\n11 terms of overall financial capital and invest capital at a\\n12 slower rate in the years following startup.

In\\n19 the case of reduced operation, the proposal may only be\\n20 accepted if the reduction in operation is reasonably expected\\n21 to be permanent. The Department shall accept applications on\\n22 an ongoing basis after beginning the program. Local government\\n23 units may submit applications jointly.\\n24 (b) The Department shall use available funds from theHB0804 - 134 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Energy Community Reinvestment Fund, subject to the provisions\\n2 of subsection (c) of Section 20-70, to provide payments to\\n3 communities for a period of no longer than 5 years from the\\n4 approval of their proposal, subject to the following\\n5 restrictions:\\n6 (1) Payments shall be assessed based on need, taking\\n7 into consideration the net amount of any increase in\\n8 payments from any other State source, including, but not\\n9 limited to, funding provided based on an evidence-based\\n10 funding formula developed by the Illinois State Board of\\n11 Education.\\n12 (2) The highest annual payment to the unit of local\\n13 government cannot exceed the lower value of either (i) the\\n14 average annual sum of property tax and other direct\\n15 payments from the fossil fuel power plant or coal mine to\\n16 the unit of local government from the most recent 3\\n17 taxable years before the reduction or cessation of\\n18 operation of the fossil fuel power plant or coal mine, or\\n19 (ii) the difference between projected local government\\n20 revenue for the years for which assistance is requested\\n21 (taking into account reasonably anticipated new revenue\\n22 sources) and the average local government revenue from the\\n23 most recent 3 taxable years before the reduction or\\n24 cessation of fossil fuel power plant or coal mine\\n25 operation. The Department may choose to consider budget\\n26 information from prior years if doing so allows theHB0804 - 135 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Department to better measure the revenue impacts of the\\n2 energy transition.\\n3 (3) The Department shall not provide funding under\\n4 this Program that exceeds the amount specified in this\\n5 paragraph (3) to any local government unit. Each unit of\\n6 local government shall not be granted by the Department a\\n7 total amount of funding over the lifetime of this Program,\\n8 for each fossil fuel power plant or coal mine, that is\\n9 greater than 5 times the average annual sum of property\\n10 tax payments and other direct payments from the fossil\\n11 fuel power plant or coal mine to the unit of local\\n12 government, calculated based on the most recent 3 taxable\\n13 years that occurred before the reduction or cessation of\\n14 operation of the fossil fuel power plant or coal mine.\\n15 (4) The Department may develop a payment schedule that\\n16 phases out support over time, based on its analysis of\\n17 available present and anticipated future funding in the\\n18 Energy Community Reinvestment Fund or other reasons\\n19 consistent with the purposes of this Act.\\n20 (5) If the total amount of qualified proposals exceeds\\n21 the available present and anticipated future funding in\\n22 the Energy Community Reinvestment Fund, the Department may\\n23 prorate payments to units of local government, or\\n24 prioritize communities for investment based on an\\n25 environmental justice screen in coordination with the\\n26 Commission on Environmental Justice, and input fromHB0804 - 136 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 stakeholders. The Department shall allocate funding in an\\n2 equitable and effective manner. Nothing in this Act shall\\n3 be interpreted to infer that units of local government\\n4 have a right to revenue replacement from the State.\\n5 (6) Funding allocated under this program may not be\\n6 used to support fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power\\n7 plants, or coal mines in any form. Any local government\\n8 unit that uses funds provided under this Act to support\\n9 fossil fuel power plants, nuclear power plants, or coal\\n10 mines shall reimburse the State for all funding used for\\n11 that purpose. If requested, the Department shall provide\\n12 guidance to local government units on whether a proposed\\n13 use of funds is considered a violation of this\\n14 requirement.\\n15 (7) At least once every 2 years following the\\n16 allocation of funds for this program, the Department shall\\n17 publish a document available online detailing the\\n18 allocation of funds, including a map that shows the\\n19 geographic distribution of the funds and the locations of\\n20 Clean Energy Empowerment Zones.\\n21 (c) The Department shall contact all units of local\\n22 government in Clean Energy Empowerment Zones and provide\\n23 information on the application process for funding under this\\n24 Section and a reasonable estimate of total funding that will\\n25 be available for this program.

For any customer, where the customer\\'s\\n14 participation has resulted in a contribution, even if the\\n15 decision adopts that customer\\'s contention or\\n16 recommendations only in part, the Commission may award the\\n17 customer compensation for all reasonable advocate\\'s fees,\\n18 reasonable expert fees, and other reasonable costs\\n19 incurred by the customer in preparing or presenting that\\n20 contention or recommendation. Participation by any\\n21 customer that materially supplements, complements, or\\n22 contributes to the presentation of another party,\\n23 including the Commission staff, that makes a contribution\\n24 to a Commission order or decision is fully eligible for\\n25 compensation.\\n26 (2) For customers with fewer than 3 attorneys onHB0804 - 201 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 staff, the customer introduces a relevant argument or\\n2 factual evidence into the docket, garners a response from\\n3 another party to the proceeding, and files briefs.\\n4 (3) For customers without attorneys on staff, the\\n5 customer introduces a relevant argument or factual\\n6 evidence into the docket.\\n7 \"Customer\" means any of the following:\\n8 (1) A participant representing consumers, customers,\\n9 or subscribers of any electrical, gas, telephone, or water\\n10 corporation that is subject to the jurisdiction of the\\n11 Commission.\\n12 (2) A representative who has been authorized by a\\n13 customer.\\n14 (3) A representative of a group or organization\\n15 authorized pursuant to its articles of incorporation or\\n16 bylaws to represent the interests of residential\\n17 customers, or to represent small commercial customers who\\n18 receive bundled electric service from an electrical\\n19 corporation.\\n20 (4) an organization representing environmental justice\\n21 communities.\\n22 \"Customer\" does not include any state, federal, or local\\n23 governmental agency, or any publicly owned public utility.\\n24 \"Customer\" must be a nonprofit organization.\\n25 \"Environmental justice communities\" means the definition\\n26 of that term based on existing methodologies and findings,HB0804 - 202 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 used and as may be updated by the Illinois Power Agency and its\\n2 program administrator in the Illinois Solar for All Program.\\n3 \"Expert witness fees\" means recorded or billed costs\\n4 incurred by a customer for an expert witness.\\n5 \"Other reasonable costs\" means reasonable out-of-pocket\\n6 expenses directly incurred by a customer that are directly\\n7 related to the contentions or recommendations made by the\\n8 customer that resulted in a contribution.\\n9 \"Party\" means any interested party, respondent public\\n10 utility, or Commission staff in a hearing or proceeding.\\n11 \"Public utility\" has the meaning ascribed to it in the\\n12 Public Utilities Act.\\n13 \"Significant financial hardship\" means either that the\\n14 customer cannot afford, without undue hardship, to pay the\\n15 costs of effective participation, including advocate\\'s fees,\\n16 expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of\\n17 participation, or that, in the case of a group or\\n18 organization, the economic interest of the individual members\\n19 of the group or organization is small in comparison to the\\n20 costs of effective participation in the proceeding.\\n21 Section 40-15. Intervenor compensation awards. The\\n22 Commission shall award reasonable advocate\\'s fees, reasonable\\n23 expert witness fees, and other reasonable costs of preparation\\n24 for and participation in a hearing or proceeding to any\\n25 customer that complies with the procedures in Section 40-20HB0804 - 203 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 and satisfies both of the following requirements:\\n2 (1) The customer\\'s presentation makes a contribution\\n3 to the adoption, in whole or in part, of the Commission\\'s\\n4 order or decision, as described in Section 40-10(b); and\\n5 (2) Participation or intervention without an award of\\n6 fees or costs imposes a significant financial hardship.\\n7 Section 40-20. Intervenor compensation award procedures.\\n8 (a)(1) A customer that intends to seek an award under this\\n9 article shall, within 30 days after the prehearing conference\\n10 is held, file and serve on all parties to the proceeding a\\n11 notice of intent to claim compensation. The Commission shall\\n12 determine the procedure to be used in cases in which:\\n13 (i) no prehearing conference is scheduled;\\n14 (ii) the Commission anticipates that the proceeding\\n15 will take less than 30 days;\\n16 (iii) the schedule would not reasonably allow parties\\n17 to identify issues within the time frame set forth in this\\n18 subsection; or\\n19 (iv) where new issues emerge after the time set for\\n20 filing.\\n21 (2)(i) The notice of intent to claim compensation shall\\n22 include both of the following:\\n23 (A) A statement of the nature and extent of the\\n24 customer\\'s planned participation in the proceeding as far\\n25 as it is possible to set it out when the notice of intentHB0804 - 204 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 is filed.\\n2 (B) An itemized estimate of the compensation that the\\n3 customer expects to request, given the likely duration of\\n4 the proceeding as it appears at the time.\\n5 (ii) The notice of intent may also include a showing by the\\n6 customer that participation in the hearing or proceeding would\\n7 pose a significant financial hardship. Alternatively, such a\\n8 showing shall be included in the request submitted pursuant to\\n9 subsection (c).\\n10 (3) Within 15 days after service of the notice of intent to\\n11 claim compensation, the administrative law judge may direct\\n12 the staff, and may permit any other interested party, to file a\\n13 statement responding to the notice.\\n14 (b)(1) If the customer\\'s showing of significant financial\\n15 hardship was included in the notice filed pursuant to\\n16 subsection (a), the administrative law judge shall issue\\n17 within 30 days thereafter a preliminary ruling addressing\\n18 whether the customer is eligible for an award of compensation.\\n19 The ruling shall address whether a showing of significant\\n20 financial hardship has been made. A finding of significant\\n21 financial hardship shall create a rebuttable presumption of\\n22 eligibility for compensation in other Commission proceedings\\n23 commencing within 2 years after the date of that finding.\\n24 (2) The administrative law judge may, in any event, issue\\n25 a ruling addressing issues raised by the notice of intent to\\n26 claim compensation. The ruling may point out similarHB0804 - 205 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 positions, areas of potential duplication in showings,\\n2 unrealistic expectation for compensation, and any other matter\\n3 that may affect the customer\\'s ultimate claim for\\n4 compensation. Failure of the ruling to point out similar\\n5 positions or potential duplication or any other potential\\n6 impact on the ultimate claim for compensation shall not imply\\n7 approval of any claim for compensation. A finding of\\n8 significant financial hardship in no way ensures compensation.\\n9 Similarly, the failure of the customer to identify a specific\\n10 issue in the notice of intent or to precisely estimate\\n11 potential compensation shall not preclude an award of\\n12 reasonable compensation if a contribution is made.\\n13 (c) Following issuance of a final order or decision by the\\n14 Commission in the hearing or proceeding, a customer that has\\n15 been found, pursuant to subsection (b), to be eligible for an\\n16 award of compensation may file within 60 days a request for an\\n17 award. The request shall include at a minimum a detailed\\n18 description of services and expenditures and a description of\\n19 the customer\\'s contribution to the hearing or proceeding.\\n20 Within 30 days after service of the request, the Commission\\n21 staff may file, and any other party may file, a response to the\\n22 request.\\n23 (d) The Commission may audit the records and books of the\\n24 customer to the extent necessary to verify the basis for the\\n25 award. The Commission shall preserve the confidentiality of\\n26 the customer\\'s records in making its audit. Within 20 daysHB0804 - 206 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 after completion of the audit, if any, the Commission shall\\n2 direct that an audit report shall be prepared and filed. Any\\n3 other party may file a response to the audit report within 20\\n4 days thereafter.\\n5 (e) Within 75 days after the filing of a request for\\n6 compensation pursuant to subsection (c), or within 50 days\\n7 after the filing of an audit report, whichever occurs later,\\n8 the Commission shall issue a decision that determines whether\\n9 or not the customer has made a contribution to the final order\\n10 or decision in the hearing or proceeding. If the Commission\\n11 finds that the customer requesting compensation has made a\\n12 contribution, the Commission shall describe this contribution\\n13 and shall determine the amount of compensation to be paid.\\n14 Section 40-25. Calculation of intervenor compensation\\n15 awards. The computation of compensation awarded shall take\\n16 into consideration the market rates paid to persons of\\n17 comparable training and experience who offer similar services.\\n18 The compensation awarded may not exceed the comparable market\\n19 rate for services paid by the Commission or the public\\n20 utility, whichever is greater, to persons of comparable\\n21 training and experience who are offering similar services.\\n22 Section 40-30. Intervenor compensation payments and cost\\n23 recovery. An award made under this Act shall be paid by the\\n24 public utility that is the subject of the hearing,HB0804 - 207 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 investigation, or proceeding, as determined by the Commission,\\n2 within 30 days.

Intervenor compensation pre-proceeding\\n15 grants.\\n16 (a) Any customer that applies for intervenor compensation\\n17 payments under subsection (a) of Section 40-20 may also, at\\n18 the same time, apply for a grant from the Illinois Commerce\\n19 Commission Intervenor Compensation Fund for the costs\\n20 described in its notice of intent to claim compensation. A\\n21 final decision regarding the grant shall be made at the time of\\n22 the preliminary ruling on intervenor compensation eligibility\\n23 in subsection (b) of Section 40-20. No pre-proceeding grant\\n24 shall be given to organizations who are not found to be\\n25 eligible for intervenor compensation. If granted, paymentsHB0804 - 209 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 must be made within 30 days to facilitate participation in the\\n2 proceeding. At the time of the final decision regarding the\\n3 grant, the Commission shall notify the customer of the\\n4 requirements to be awarded intervenor compensation and that,\\n5 if the customer does not prevail in receiving intervenor\\n6 compensation of at least the amount of the grant, the customer\\n7 will be expected to reimburse the Illinois Commerce Commission\\n8 Intervenor Compensation Fund for the remaining grant moneys on\\n9 a regular schedule within 5 years of the end of the proceeding.\\n10 After notification, the customer may accept or deny receipt of\\n11 the grant.\\n12 (b) To apply for a grant from the Illinois Commerce\\n13 Commission Intervenor Compensation Fund, the customer must\\n14 describe why prepayment of intervenor compensation is\\n15 necessary for it to participate in the proceeding and show\\n16 financial hardship sufficient that the customer cannot\\n17 reasonably be expected to participate without receiving a\\n18 grant.\\n19 (c) If a customer that receives a grant from the Illinois\\n20 Commerce Commission Intervenor Compensation Fund subsequently\\n21 prevails in receiving intervenor compensation, the public\\n22 utility paying intervenor compensation must reimburse the fund\\n23 for the amount of the grant. If the intervenor compensation\\n24 amount is larger than the grant, then the balance shall be paid\\n25 to the customer. If the amount of intervenor compensation is\\n26 less than the grant, then the customer must reimburse theHB0804 - 210 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Illinois Commerce Commission Intervenor Compensation Fund for\\n2 the difference with payments made on a regular schedule within\\n3 5 years after the end of the proceeding.\\n4 (d) If a customer that receives a grant from the Illinois\\n5 Commerce Commission Intervenor Compensation Fund does not\\n6 subsequently prevail in receiving intervenor compensation,\\n7 then the customer must reimburse the Illinois Commerce\\n8 Commission Intervenor Compensation Fund for the amount of the\\n9 grant with payments made on a regular schedule within 5 years\\n10 of the end of the proceeding.\\n11 Section 40-50. Rulemaking. The Commission shall adopt any\\n12 rules necessary to implement this Act. The Commission has the\\n13 authority to initiate an emergency rulemaking to adopt rules\\n14 regarding intervenor compensation if necessary to allow\\n15 customer participation in dockets implementing new statutes.\\n16 Article 45.Electric Vehicle Charging Act\\n17 Section 45-1.

The\\n14 General Assembly finds and declares:\\n15 (1) The health, welfare, and prosperity of all\\n16 Illinois residents citizens require the provision of\\n17 adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and\\n18 environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest\\n19 total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of\\n20 price stability.\\n21 (1.5) To provide the highest quality of life for the\\n22 residents of Illinois, and to provide for a clean and\\n23 healthy environment, it is the policy of this State to\\n24 rapidly transition to 100% renewable energy.HB0804 - 248 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (2) (Blank).\\n2 (3) (Blank).\\n3 (4) It is necessary to improve the process of\\n4 procuring electricity to serve Illinois residents, to\\n5 promote investment in energy efficiency and\\n6 demand-response measures, and to maintain and support\\n7 development of clean coal technologies, generation\\n8 resources that operate at all hours of the day and under\\n9 all weather conditions, zero emission facilities, and\\n10 renewable resources.\\n11 (5) Procuring a diverse electricity supply portfolio\\n12 will ensure the lowest total cost over time for adequate,\\n13 reliable, efficient, and environmentally sustainable\\n14 electric service.\\n15 (6) Including renewable resources and zero emission\\n16 credits from zero emission facilities in that portfolio\\n17 will reduce long-term direct and indirect costs to\\n18 consumers by decreasing environmental impacts and by\\n19 avoiding or delaying the need for new generation,\\n20 transmission, and distribution infrastructure. Developing\\n21 new renewable energy resources in Illinois, including\\n22 brownfield solar projects and community solar projects,\\n23 will help to diversify Illinois electricity supply, avoid\\n24 and reduce pollution, reduce peak demand, and enhance\\n25 public health and well-being of Illinois residents.\\n26 (7) Developing community solar projects in IllinoisHB0804 - 249 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 will help to expand access to renewable energy resources\\n2 to more Illinois residents.\\n3 (8) Developing brownfield solar projects in Illinois\\n4 will help return blighted or contaminated land to\\n5 productive use while enhancing public health and the\\n6 well-being of Illinois residents, including those in\\n7 environmental justice communities.\\n8 (9) Energy efficiency, demand-response measures, zero\\n9 emission energy, and renewable energy are resources\\n10 currently underused in Illinois. These resources should be\\n11 used, when cost effective, to reduce costs to consumers,\\n12 improve reliability, and improve environmental quality and\\n13 public health.\\n14 (10) The State should encourage the use of advanced\\n15 clean coal technologies that capture and sequester carbon\\n16 dioxide emissions to advance environmental protection\\n17 goals and to demonstrate the viability of coal and\\n18 coal-derived fuels in a carbon-constrained economy.\\n19 (11) The General Assembly enacted Public Act 96-0795\\n20 to reform the State\\'s purchasing processes, recognizing\\n21 that government procurement is susceptible to abuse if\\n22 structural and procedural safeguards are not in place to\\n23 ensure independence, insulation, oversight, and\\n24 transparency.\\n25 (12) The principles that underlie the procurement\\n26 reform legislation apply also in the context of powerHB0804 - 250 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 purchasing.\\n2 (13) To ensure that the benefits of installing\\n3 renewable resources are available to all Illinois\\n4 residents and located across the State, subject to\\n5 appropriation, it is necessary for the Illinois Power\\n6 Agency to provide public information and educational\\n7 resources on how residents can benefit from the expansion\\n8 of renewable energy in Illinois and participate in the\\n9 Illinois Solar for All Program established in Section 1-56\\n10 of this Act, the Adjustable Block Program established in\\n11 Section 1-75 of this Act, the job training programs\\n12 established by paragraph (1) of subsection (a) of Section\\n13 16-108.12 of the Public Utilities Act, and the programs\\n14 and resources established by the Clean Jobs Workforce and\\n15 Contractor Equity Act.\\n16 The General Assembly therefore finds that it is necessary\\n17 to create the Illinois Power Agency and that the goals and\\n18 objectives of that Agency are to accomplish each of the\\n19 following:\\n20 (A) Develop electricity procurement plans to ensure\\n21 adequate, reliable, affordable, efficient, and\\n22 environmentally sustainable electric service at the lowest\\n23 total cost over time, taking into account any benefits of\\n24 price stability, for electric utilities that on December\\n25 31, 2005 provided electric service to at least 100,000\\n26 customers in Illinois and for small multi-jurisdictionalHB0804 - 251 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 electric utilities that (i) on December 31, 2005 served\\n2 less than 100,000 customers in Illinois and (ii) request a\\n3 procurement plan for their Illinois jurisdictional load.\\n4 The procurement plan shall be updated on an annual basis\\n5 and shall include renewable energy resources and,\\n6 beginning with the delivery year commencing June 1, 2017,\\n7 zero emission credits from zero emission facilities\\n8 sufficient to achieve the standards specified in this Act.\\n9 (B) Conduct the competitive procurement processes\\n10 identified in this Act.\\n11 (C) Develop electric generation and co-generation\\n12 facilities that use indigenous coal or renewable\\n13 resources, or both, financed with bonds issued by the\\n14 Illinois Finance Authority.\\n15 (D) Supply electricity from the Agency\\'s facilities at\\n16 cost to one or more of the following: municipal electric\\n17 systems, governmental aggregators, or rural electric\\n18 cooperatives in Illinois.\\n19 (E) Ensure that the process of power procurement is\\n20 conducted in an ethical and transparent fashion, immune\\n21 from improper influence.\\n22 (F) Continue to review its policies and practices to\\n23 determine how best to meet its mission of providing the\\n24 lowest cost power to the greatest number of people, at any\\n25 given point in time, in accordance with applicable law.\\n26 (G) Operate in a structurally insulated, independent,HB0804 - 252 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 and transparent fashion so that nothing impedes the\\n2 Agency\\'s mission to secure power at the best prices the\\n3 market will bear, provided that the Agency meets all\\n4 applicable legal requirements.\\n5 (H) Implement renewable energy procurement and\\n6 training programs throughout the State to diversify\\n7 Illinois electricity supply, improve reliability, avoid\\n8 and reduce pollution, reduce peak demand, and enhance\\n9 public health and well-being of Illinois residents,\\n10 including low-income residents.\\n11 (Source: P.A. 99-906, eff. 6-1-17.)\\n12 (20 ILCS 3855/1-10)\\n13 Sec. 1-10.

The Agency shall reserve a portion of\\n16 this program for projects that promote energy\\n17 sovereignty through ownership of projects by\\n18 low-income households, not-for-profit organizations\\n19 providing services to low-income households,\\n20 affordable housing owners, or community-based limited\\n21 liability companies providing services to low-income\\n22 households. To count as promoting energy sovereignty,\\n23 49% of the ownership interest of the project must be\\n24 held by low-income households, not-for-profit\\n25 organizations providing direct services to low-income\\n26 households, affordable housing owners, orHB0804 - 284 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 community-based limited liability companies providing\\n2 services to low-income households, by no later than 6\\n3 years after the device is interconnected at the\\n4 distribution system level of the utility and\\n5 energized. Incentives for projects that promote energy\\n6 sovereignty may be higher than incentives for\\n7 equivalent projects that do not promote energy\\n8 sovereignty under this same program. Contracts entered\\n9 into under this paragraph may be entered into with an\\n10 entity that will develop and administer the program\\n11 and shall include contracts for renewable energy\\n12 credits from the photovoltaic distributed generation\\n13 that is the subject of the program, as set forth in the\\n14 long-term renewable resources procurement plan.\\n15 The requirement that a qualified person, as defined in\\n16 paragraph (1) of subsection (i) of this Section, install\\n17 photovoltaic devices does not apply to the Illinois Solar\\n18 for All Program described in this subsection (b).\\n19 (3) Costs associated with the Illinois Solar for All\\n20 Program and its components described in paragraph (2) of\\n21 this subsection (b), including, but not limited to, costs\\n22 associated with procuring experts, consultants, and the\\n23 program administrator referenced in this subsection (b)\\n24 and related incremental costs, costs related to income\\n25 verification and facilitating customer participation in\\n26 the program, and costs related to the evaluation of theHB0804 - 285 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Illinois Solar for All Program, may be paid for using\\n2 monies in the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy\\n3 Resources Fund, but the Agency or program administrator\\n4 shall strive to minimize costs in the implementation of\\n5 the program. The Agency shall purchase renewable energy\\n6 credits from generation that is the subject of a contract\\n7 under subparagraphs (A) through (E) (D) of this paragraph\\n8 (2) of this subsection (b), and may pay for such renewable\\n9 energy credits through an upfront payment per installed\\n10 kilowatt of nameplate capacity paid once the device is\\n11 interconnected at the distribution system level of the\\n12 utility and is energized. The payment shall be in exchange\\n13 for an assignment of all renewable energy credits\\n14 generated by the system during the first 15 years of\\n15 operation and shall be structured to overcome barriers to\\n16 participation in the solar market by the low-income\\n17 community. The incentives provided for in this Section may\\n18 be implemented through the pricing of renewable energy\\n19 credits where the prices paid for the credits are higher\\n20 than the prices from programs offered under subsection (c)\\n21 of Section 1-75 of this Act to account for the incentives.\\n22 The Agency shall ensure collaboration with community\\n23 agencies, and allocate up to 5% of the funds available\\n24 under the Illinois Solar for All Program to\\n25 community-based groups to assist in grassroots education\\n26 efforts related to the Illinois Solar for All Program. TheHB0804 - 286 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Agency shall retire any renewable energy credits purchased\\n2 from this program and the credits shall count towards the\\n3 obligation under subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this\\n4 Act for the electric utility to which the project is\\n5 interconnected. The Agency may combine the funding for the\\n6 Adjustable Block Program established in subparagraph (K)\\n7 of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 and the\\n8 Illinois Solar for All Program to purchase renewable\\n9 energy credits from new photovoltaic projects that would\\n10 be eligible for either program so long as: the annual\\n11 ratepayer funds collected to purchase renewable resources\\n12 pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 1-75 is at least\\n13 double the amount collected in the 2019-2020 delivery\\n14 year, no more than 20% of any individual block within the\\n15 Adjustable Block Program is allocated to Solar for\\n16 All-eligible projects, and the funding sources for both\\n17 programs are the same for projects so funded. Any\\n18 renewable energy credits purchased from this program in\\n19 combination with the Adjustable Block Program shall count\\n20 toward the obligation for new photovoltaic projects under\\n21 subparagraph (C) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of\\n22 Section 1-75 of this Act. Any photovoltaic projects\\n23 selected for this program in combination with the\\n24 Adjustable Block Program are subject to the requirements\\n25 of the Illinois Solar for All Program and may receive\\n26 Illinois Solar for All Program pricing, with the IllinoisHB0804 - 287 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Solar for All Program budget covering the difference\\n2 between the renewable energy credit price from the\\n3 currently open block of the Adjustable Block Program and\\n4 the Solar for All renewable energy credit price. Illinois\\n5 Solar for All subprograms providing funding for\\n6 installation of distributed renewable energy generation\\n7 devices shall use funding in this manner from Adjustable\\n8 Block Program distributed renewable energy generation\\n9 device blocks. The Illinois Solar for All Low-Income\\n10 Community Solar subprogram shall use funding in this\\n11 manner from the Adjustable Block Program community\\n12 renewable generation project blocks, if such blocks are\\n13 legally authorized. If no Adjustable Block Program\\n14 community renewable generation project block is currently\\n15 legally authorized and if a competitively procured\\n16 Community Solar Program is legally authorized under\\n17 Section 1-75 of this Act, then (i) a portion of the\\n18 utility-held renewable resources budget allocated by the\\n19 Agency to such competitive Community Solar Program each\\n20 year shall be reserved for the Solar for All Low-Income\\n21 Community Solar subprogram as if such budget came from an\\n22 Adjustable Block Program block for purposes of this\\n23 paragraph (3) and (ii) the average renewable energy credit\\n24 price of Community Solar Program selected projects from\\n25 the prior delivery year (or a shorter period, if a full\\n26 delivery year of the Community Solar Program has not beenHB0804 - 288 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 completed) shall be used for allocating funding to the\\n2 Solar for All Low-Income Community Solar subprogram in\\n3 lieu of the Adjustable Block Program renewable energy\\n4 credit block price mentioned earlier in this paragraph\\n5 (3). The Agency shall try to manage program capacities and\\n6 budgets to make the fullest use of this option to\\n7 accommodate Solar for All project applications.\\n8 (4) The Agency shall, consistent with the requirements\\n9 of this subsection (b), propose the Illinois Solar for All\\n10 Program terms, conditions, and requirements, including the\\n11 prices to be paid for renewable energy credits, and which\\n12 prices may be determined through a formula, through the\\n13 development, review, and approval of the Agency\\'s\\n14 long-term renewable resources procurement plan described\\n15 in subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of this Act and Section\\n16 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act. In the course of the\\n17 Commission proceeding initiated to review and approve the\\n18 plan, including the Illinois Solar for All Program\\n19 proposed by the Agency, a party may propose an additional\\n20 low-income solar or solar incentive program, or\\n21 modifications to the programs proposed by the Agency, and\\n22 the Commission may approve an additional program, or\\n23 modifications to the Agency\\'s proposed program, if the\\n24 additional or modified program more effectively maximizes\\n25 the benefits to low-income customers after taking into\\n26 account all relevant factors, including, but not limitedHB0804 - 289 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 to, the extent to which a competitive market for\\n2 low-income solar has developed. Following the Commission\\'s\\n3 approval of the Illinois Solar for All Program, the Agency\\n4 or a party may propose adjustments to the program terms,\\n5 conditions, and requirements, including the price offered\\n6 to new systems, to ensure the long-term viability and\\n7 success of the program. The Commission shall review and\\n8 approve any modifications to the program through the plan\\n9 revision process described in Section 16-111.5 of the\\n10 Public Utilities Act.\\n11 (5) The Agency shall issue a request for\\n12 qualifications for a third-party program administrator or\\n13 administrators to administer all or a portion of the\\n14 Illinois Solar for All Program.

The Illinois target renewable\\n5 energy credit quantity for the delivery year beginning\\n6 June 1, 2018 is 14.5% multiplied by the total amount of\\n7 metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered in the\\n8 delivery year immediately preceding that delivery\\n9 year, provided that the 14.5% shall increase by 1.5%\\n10 each delivery year thereafter to 25% by the delivery\\n11 year beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the 25%\\n12 value shall apply to each delivery year.\\n13 If the requirements set forth in items (i) through\\n14 (iii) of this subparagraph (H) are met, the charges\\n15 that would otherwise be applicable to the retail\\n16 customers of the alternative retail electric supplier\\n17 under paragraph (6) of this subsection (c) for the\\n18 applicable delivery year shall be reduced by the ratio\\n19 of the quantity of renewable energy credits supplied\\n20 by the alternative retail electric supplier compared\\n21 to that supplier\\'s target renewable energy credit\\n22 quantity. The supplier\\'s target renewable energy\\n23 credit quantity for the delivery year beginning June\\n24 1, 2018 is 14.5% multiplied by the total amount of\\n25 metered electricity (megawatt-hours) delivered by the\\n26 alternative retail supplier in that delivery year,HB0804 - 335 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 provided that the 14.5% shall increase by 1.5% each\\n2 delivery year thereafter to 25% by the delivery year\\n3 beginning June 1, 2025, and thereafter the 25% value\\n4 shall apply to each delivery year.\\n5 On or before April 1 of each year, the Agency shall\\n6 annually publish a report on its website that\\n7 identifies the aggregate amount of renewable energy\\n8 credits supplied by alternative retail electric\\n9 suppliers under this subparagraph (H).\\n10 (I) The Agency shall design its long-term renewable\\n11 energy procurement plan to maximize the State\\'s interest\\n12 in the health, safety, and welfare of its residents,\\n13 including but not limited to minimizing sulfur dioxide,\\n14 nitrogen oxide, particulate matter and other pollution\\n15 that adversely affects public health in this State,\\n16 increasing fuel and resource diversity in this State,\\n17 enhancing the reliability and resiliency of the\\n18 electricity distribution system in this State, meeting\\n19 goals to limit carbon dioxide emissions under federal or\\n20 State law, and contributing to a cleaner and healthier\\n21 environment for the residents citizens of this State. In\\n22 order to further these legislative purposes, renewable\\n23 energy credits shall be eligible to be counted toward the\\n24 renewable energy requirements of this subsection (c) if\\n25 they are generated from facilities located in this State.\\n26 The Agency may qualify renewable energy credits fromHB0804 - 336 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 facilities located in states adjacent to Illinois if the\\n2 generator demonstrates and the Agency determines that the\\n3 operation of such facility or facilities will help promote\\n4 the State\\'s interest in the health, safety, and welfare of\\n5 its residents based on the public interest criteria\\n6 described above. To ensure that the public interest\\n7 criteria are applied to the procurement and given full\\n8 effect, the Agency\\'s long-term procurement plan shall\\n9 describe in detail how each public interest factor shall\\n10 be considered and weighted for facilities located in\\n11 states adjacent to Illinois.\\n12 (J) In order to promote the competitive development of\\n13 renewable energy resources in furtherance of the State\\'s\\n14 interest in the health, safety, and welfare of its\\n15 residents, renewable energy credits shall not be eligible\\n16 to be counted toward the renewable energy requirements of\\n17 this subsection (c) if they are sourced from a generating\\n18 unit whose costs were being recovered through rates\\n19 regulated by this State or any other state or states on or\\n20 after January 1, 2017. Each contract executed to purchase\\n21 renewable energy credits under this subsection (c) shall\\n22 provide for the contract\\'s termination if the costs of the\\n23 generating unit supplying the renewable energy credits\\n24 subsequently begin to be recovered through rates regulated\\n25 by this State or any other state or states; and each\\n26 contract shall further provide that, in that event, theHB0804 - 337 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 supplier of the credits must return 110% of all payments\\n2 received under the contract. Amounts returned under the\\n3 requirements of this subparagraph (J) shall be retained by\\n4 the utility and all of these amounts shall be used for the\\n5 procurement of additional renewable energy credits from\\n6 new wind or new photovoltaic resources as defined in this\\n7 subsection (c). The long-term plan shall provide that\\n8 these renewable energy credits shall be procured in the\\n9 next procurement event.\\n10 Notwithstanding the limitations of this subparagraph\\n11 (J), renewable energy credits sourced from generating\\n12 units that are constructed, purchased, owned, or leased by\\n13 an electric utility as part of an approved project,\\n14 program, or pilot under Section 1-56 of this Act shall be\\n15 eligible to be counted toward the renewable energy\\n16 requirements of this subsection (c), regardless of how the\\n17 costs of these units are recovered.\\n18 (K) The long-term renewable resources procurement plan\\n19 developed by the Agency in accordance with subparagraph\\n20 (A) of this paragraph (1) shall include an Adjustable\\n21 Block program for the procurement of renewable energy\\n22 credits from new photovoltaic projects that are\\n23 distributed renewable energy generation devices or new\\n24 photovoltaic community renewable generation projects. The\\n25 Adjustable Block program shall be designed to provide for\\n26 the steady, predictable, and sustainable growth of newHB0804 - 338 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 solar photovoltaic development in Illinois. To this end,\\n2 the Adjustable Block program shall provide a transparent\\n3 annual schedule of prices and quantities to enable the\\n4 photovoltaic market to scale up and for renewable energy\\n5 credit prices to adjust at a predictable rate over time.\\n6 The prices set by the Adjustable Block program can be\\n7 reflected as a set value or as the product of a formula.\\n8 The Adjustable Block program shall include for each\\n9 category of eligible projects: a schedule of standard\\n10 block purchase prices to be offered; a series of steps,\\n11 with associated nameplate capacity and purchase prices\\n12 that adjust from step to step; and automatic opening of\\n13 the next step as soon as the nameplate capacity and\\n14 available purchase prices for an open step are fully\\n15 committed or reserved. Only projects energized on or after\\n16 June 1, 2017 shall be eligible for the Adjustable Block\\n17 program. The Agency shall develop program features and\\n18 implementation processes that create consistent market\\n19 signals, making the program predictable and sustainable\\n20 for solar industry companies, thus allowing them to scale\\n21 up long-term hiring and investment activities. For each\\n22 block group the Agency shall determine the number of\\n23 blocks, the amount of generation capacity in each block,\\n24 and the purchase price for each block, provided that the\\n25 purchase price provided and the total amount of generation\\n26 in all blocks for all block groups shall be sufficient toHB0804 - 339 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 meet the goals in this subsection (c). The Agency shall\\n2 establish program eligibility requirements that ensure\\n3 that projects that enter the program are sufficiently\\n4 mature to indicate a demonstrable path to completion. The\\n5 Agency may periodically review its prior decisions\\n6 establishing the number of blocks, the amount of\\n7 generation capacity in each block, and the purchase price\\n8 for each block, and may propose, on an expedited basis,\\n9 changes to these previously set values, including but not\\n10 limited to redistributing these amounts and the available\\n11 funds as necessary and appropriate, subject to Commission\\n12 approval as part of the periodic plan revision process\\n13 described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.\\n14 The Agency may define different block sizes, purchase\\n15 prices, or other distinct terms and conditions for\\n16 projects located in different utility service territories\\n17 if the Agency deems it necessary to meet the goals in this\\n18 subsection (c).\\n19 The Adjustable Block program shall include at least\\n20 the following block groups in at least the following\\n21 amounts, which may be adjusted upon review by the Agency\\n22 and approval by the Commission as described in this\\n23 subparagraph (K):\\n24 (i) At least 25% from distributed renewable energy\\n25 generation devices with a nameplate capacity of no\\n26 more than 25 10 kilowatts.HB0804 - 340 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (ii) At least 25% from distributed renewable\\n2 energy generation devices with a nameplate capacity of\\n3 more than 25 10 kilowatts and no more than 2,000\\n4 kilowatts. The Agency may create sub-categories within\\n5 this category to account for the differences between\\n6 projects for small commercial customers, large\\n7 commercial customers, and public or non-profit\\n8 customers.\\n9 (iii) other block groups as specified by the\\n10 Agency and approved by the Commission in the long-term\\n11 renewable resources procurement plan in order to meet\\n12 the goals of this subsection (c) At least 25% from\\n13 photovoltaic community renewable generation projects.\\n14 (iv) The remaining 25% shall be allocated as\\n15 specified by the Agency in the long-term renewable\\n16 resources procurement plan.\\n17 The Adjustable Block program shall be designed to\\n18 ensure that renewable energy credits are procured from\\n19 photovoltaic distributed renewable energy generation\\n20 devices and new photovoltaic community renewable energy\\n21 generation projects in diverse locations, including urban\\n22 and rural areas, and are not concentrated in a few\\n23 geographic areas or excluding particular geographic areas.\\n24 The Adjustable Block program shall reserve 15% of each\\n25 block\\'s capacity at the block\\'s pricing to be available\\n26 for qualified vendors that are participants in theHB0804 - 341 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Illinois Clean Energy Black, Indigenous, and People of\\n2 Color Contractor Accelerator, as described in the Clean\\n3 Jobs, Workforce and Contractor Equity Act, and a total of\\n4 40% of each block\\'s capacity at the block\\'s price to be\\n5 available for qualified vendors that score no less than\\n6 105 points in the equity points system described in\\n7 subparagraphs (A) through (H) of paragraph (7) of this\\n8 subsection (c). Nothing in this paragraph shall prohibit\\n9 the opening of additional blocks for the unreserved\\n10 capacity of each block. Beginning with the first update to\\n11 the Long-Term Renewable Resources Procurement Plan after\\n12 December 31, 2024, the Agency shall review the reserved\\n13 capacity level for future blocks. In developing its annual\\n14 budgets, the Agency shall project the amount of\\n15 development in each block, at the prices of each block,\\n16 expected to occur in the budget timeframe.\\n17 Immediately upon the effective date of this amendatory\\n18 Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Adjustable Block\\n19 Program shall stop accepting applications from community\\n20 renewable generation projects and shall stop allocating\\n21 capacity remaining in open or future blocks to community\\n22 renewable generation projects.\\n23 (L) The procurement of photovoltaic renewable energy\\n24 credits under the Adjustable Block Program established\\n25 under items (i) through (iv) of subparagraph (K) and the\\n26 Community Solar Program established under subparagraph (N)HB0804 - 342 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 of this paragraph (1) shall be subject to the following\\n2 contract and payment terms:\\n3 (i) The Agency shall procure contracts of at least\\n4 15 years in length.\\n5 (ii) For those renewable energy credits that\\n6 qualify and are procured from projects with a\\n7 nameplate capacity of no more than 10 kilowatts under\\n8 item (i) of subparagraph (K) of this paragraph (1),\\n9 the renewable energy credit purchase price shall be\\n10 paid in full by the contracting utilities at the time\\n11 that the facility producing the renewable energy\\n12 credits is interconnected at the distribution system\\n13 level of the utility and energized. The electric\\n14 utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy\\n15 credits generated by the project for the first 15\\n16 years of operation.\\n17 (iii) For those renewable energy credits that\\n18 qualify and are procured from projects with a\\n19 nameplate capacity of more than 10 kilowatts but no\\n20 more than 200 kilowatts or, if approved at the\\n21 recommendation of the Agency in its long-term plan,\\n22 from projects that include a community ownership\\n23 component or are owned by a nonprofit or public entity\\n24 under item (ii) and (iii) of subparagraph (K) of this\\n25 paragraph (1) and any additional categories of\\n26 distributed generation included in the long-termHB0804 - 343 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 renewable resources procurement plan and approved by\\n2 the Commission, 20 percent of the renewable energy\\n3 credit purchase price shall be paid by the contracting\\n4 utilities at the time that the facility producing the\\n5 renewable energy credits is interconnected at the\\n6 distribution system level of the utility and\\n7 energized. The remaining portion shall be paid ratably\\n8 over the subsequent 4-year period. The electric\\n9 utility shall receive and retire all renewable energy\\n10 credits generated by the project for the first 15\\n11 years of operation.\\n12 (iv) For those renewable energy credits that\\n13 qualify and are procured from all other projects under\\n14 subparagraph (K) or (N) of this paragraph (1), the\\n15 renewable energy credit purchase price shall be paid\\n16 by the contracting utilities over the 15-year life of\\n17 the contract. The electric utility shall receive and\\n18 retire all renewable energy credits generated by the\\n19 project for the first 15 years of operation.\\n20 (v) (iv) Each contract shall include provisions to\\n21 ensure the delivery of the renewable energy credits\\n22 for the full term of the contract.\\n23 (vi) (v) The utility shall be the counterparty to\\n24 the contracts executed under this subparagraph (L)\\n25 that are approved by the Commission under the process\\n26 described in Section 16-111.5 of the Public UtilitiesHB0804 - 344 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Act. No contract shall be executed for an amount that\\n2 is less than one renewable energy credit per year.\\n3 (vii) (vi) If, at any time, approved applications\\n4 for the Adjustable Block program exceed funds\\n5 collected by the electric utility or would cause the\\n6 Agency to exceed the limitation described in\\n7 subparagraph (E) of this paragraph (1) on the amount\\n8 of renewable energy resources that may be procured,\\n9 then the Agency shall consider future uncommitted\\n10 funds to be reserved for these contracts on a\\n11 first-come, first-served basis, with the delivery of\\n12 renewable energy credits required beginning at the\\n13 time that the reserved funds become available.\\n14 (viii) (vii) Nothing in this Section shall require\\n15 the utility to advance any payment or pay any amounts\\n16 that exceed, in a given delivery year, (i) the actual\\n17 amount of revenues collected by the utility in the\\n18 delivery year and unspent available revenues from\\n19 prior delivery years, in both cases under paragraph\\n20 (6) of this subsection (c) and subsection (k) of\\n21 Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act and (ii)\\n22 other utility-held funds authorized for renewables\\n23 procurement by order of the Illinois Commerce\\n24 Commission.

The Commission shall have authority to inspect\\n23 all books and records associated with these clean coal\\n24 facilities during the term of any such contract.\\n25 (6) Costs incurred under this subsection (d) or\\n26 pursuant to a contract entered into under this subsectionHB0804 - 385 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (d) shall be deemed prudently incurred and reasonable in\\n2 amount and the electric utility shall be entitled to full\\n3 cost recovery pursuant to the tariffs filed with the\\n4 Commission.\\n5 (d-5) Zero emission standard.\\n6 (1) Beginning with the delivery year commencing on\\n7 June 1, 2017, the Agency shall, for electric utilities\\n8 that serve at least 100,000 retail customers in this\\n9 State, procure contracts with zero emission facilities\\n10 that are reasonably capable of generating cost-effective\\n11 zero emission credits in an amount approximately equal to\\n12 16% of the actual amount of electricity delivered by each\\n13 electric utility to retail customers in the State during\\n14 calendar year 2014. For an electric utility serving fewer\\n15 than 100,000 retail customers in this State that\\n16 requested, under Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities\\n17 Act, that the Agency procure power and energy for all or a\\n18 portion of the utility\\'s Illinois load for the delivery\\n19 year commencing June 1, 2016, the Agency shall procure\\n20 contracts with zero emission facilities that are\\n21 reasonably capable of generating cost-effective zero\\n22 emission credits in an amount approximately equal to 16%\\n23 of the portion of power and energy to be procured by the\\n24 Agency for the utility. The duration of the contracts\\n25 procured under this subsection (d-5) shall be for a term\\n26 of 10 years ending May 31, 2027. The quantity of zeroHB0804 - 386 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 emission credits to be procured under the contracts shall\\n2 be all of the zero emission credits generated by the zero\\n3 emission facility in each delivery year; however, if the\\n4 zero emission facility is owned by more than one entity,\\n5 then the quantity of zero emission credits to be procured\\n6 under the contracts shall be the amount of zero emission\\n7 credits that are generated from the portion of the zero\\n8 emission facility that is owned by the winning supplier.\\n9 The 16% value identified in this paragraph (1) is the\\n10 average of the percentage targets in subparagraph (B) of\\n11 paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of this Section for the 5\\n12 delivery years beginning June 1, 2017.\\n13 The procurement process shall be subject to the\\n14 following provisions:\\n15 (A) Those zero emission facilities that intend to\\n16 participate in the procurement shall submit to the\\n17 Agency the following eligibility information for each\\n18 zero emission facility on or before the date\\n19 established by the Agency:\\n20 (i) the in-service date and remaining useful\\n21 life of the zero emission facility;\\n22 (ii) the amount of power generated annually\\n23 for each of the years 2005 through 2015, and the\\n24 projected zero emission credits to be generated\\n25 over the remaining useful life of the zero\\n26 emission facility, which shall be used toHB0804 - 387 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 determine the capability of each facility;\\n2 (iii) the annual zero emission facility cost\\n3 projections, expressed on a per megawatthour\\n4 basis, over the next 6 delivery years, which shall\\n5 include the following: operation and maintenance\\n6 expenses; fully allocated overhead costs, which\\n7 shall be allocated using the methodology developed\\n8 by the Institute for Nuclear Power Operations;\\n9 fuel expenditures; non-fuel capital expenditures;\\n10 spent fuel expenditures; a return on working\\n11 capital; the cost of operational and market risks\\n12 that could be avoided by ceasing operation; and\\n13 any other costs necessary for continued\\n14 operations, provided that \"necessary\" means, for\\n15 purposes of this item (iii), that the costs could\\n16 reasonably be avoided only by ceasing operations\\n17 of the zero emission facility; and\\n18 (iv) a commitment to continue operating, for\\n19 the duration of the contract or contracts executed\\n20 under the procurement held under this subsection\\n21 (d-5), the zero emission facility that produces\\n22 the zero emission credits to be procured in the\\n23 procurement.\\n24 The information described in item (iii) of this\\n25 subparagraph (A) may be submitted on a confidential\\n26 basis and shall be treated and maintained by theHB0804 - 388 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Agency, the procurement administrator, and the\\n2 Commission as confidential and proprietary and exempt\\n3 from disclosure under subparagraphs (a) and (g) of\\n4 paragraph (1) of Section 7 of the Freedom of\\n5 Information Act. The Office of Attorney General shall\\n6 have access to, and maintain the confidentiality of,\\n7 such information pursuant to Section 6.5 of the\\n8 Attorney General Act.\\n9 (B) The price for each zero emission credit\\n10 procured under this subsection (d-5) for each delivery\\n11 year shall be in an amount that equals the Social Cost\\n12 of Carbon, expressed on a price per megawatthour\\n13 basis. However, to ensure that the procurement remains\\n14 affordable to retail customers in this State if\\n15 electricity prices increase, the price in an\\n16 applicable delivery year shall be reduced below the\\n17 Social Cost of Carbon by the amount (\"Price\\n18 Adjustment\") by which the market price index for the\\n19 applicable delivery year exceeds the baseline market\\n20 price index for the consecutive 12-month period ending\\n21 May 31, 2016. If the Price Adjustment is greater than\\n22 or equal to the Social Cost of Carbon in an applicable\\n23 delivery year, then no payments shall be due in that\\n24 delivery year. The components of this calculation are\\n25 defined as follows:\\n26 (i) Social Cost of Carbon: The Social Cost ofHB0804 - 389 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Carbon is $16.50 per megawatthour, which is based\\n2 on the U.S. Interagency Working Group on Social\\n3 Cost of Carbon\\'s price in the August 2016\\n4 Technical Update using a 3% discount rate,\\n5 adjusted for inflation for each year of the\\n6 program. Beginning with the delivery year\\n7 commencing June 1, 2023, the price per\\n8 megawatthour shall increase by $1 per\\n9 megawatthour, and continue to increase by an\\n10 additional $1 per megawatthour each delivery year\\n11 thereafter.\\n12 (ii) Baseline market price index: The baseline\\n13 market price index for the consecutive 12-month\\n14 period ending May 31, 2016 is $31.40 per\\n15 megawatthour, which is based on the sum of (aa)\\n16 the average day-ahead energy price across all\\n17 hours of such 12-month period at the PJM\\n18 Interconnection LLC Northern Illinois Hub, (bb)\\n19 50% multiplied by the Base Residual Auction, or\\n20 its successor, capacity price for the rest of the\\n21 RTO zone group determined by PJM Interconnection\\n22 LLC, divided by 24 hours per day, and (cc) 50%\\n23 multiplied by the Planning Resource Auction, or\\n24 its successor, capacity price for Zone 4\\n25 determined by the Midcontinent Independent System\\n26 Operator, Inc., divided by 24 hours per day.HB0804 - 390 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (iii) Market price index: The market price\\n2 index for a delivery year shall be the sum of\\n3 projected energy prices and projected capacity\\n4 prices determined as follows:\\n5 (aa) Projected energy prices: the\\n6 projected energy prices for the applicable\\n7 delivery year shall be calculated once for the\\n8 year using the forward market price for the\\n9 PJM Interconnection, LLC Northern Illinois\\n10 Hub. The forward market price shall be\\n11 calculated as follows: the energy forward\\n12 prices for each month of the applicable\\n13 delivery year averaged for each trade date\\n14 during the calendar year immediately preceding\\n15 that delivery year to produce a single energy\\n16 forward price for the delivery year. The\\n17 forward market price calculation shall use\\n18 data published by the Intercontinental\\n19 Exchange, or its successor.\\n20 (bb) Projected capacity prices:\\n21 (I) For the delivery years commencing\\n22 June 1, 2017, June 1, 2018, and June 1,\\n23 2019, the projected capacity price shall\\n24 be equal to the sum of (1) 50% multiplied\\n25 by the Base Residual Auction, or its\\n26 successor, price for the rest of the RTOHB0804 - 391 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 zone group as determined by PJM\\n2 Interconnection LLC, divided by 24 hours\\n3 per day and, (2) 50% multiplied by the\\n4 resource auction price determined in the\\n5 resource auction administered by the\\n6 Midcontinent Independent System Operator,\\n7 Inc., in which the largest percentage of\\n8 load cleared for Local Resource Zone 4,\\n9 divided by 24 hours per day, and where\\n10 such price is determined by the\\n11 Midcontinent Independent System Operator,\\n12 Inc.\\n13 (II) For the delivery year commencing\\n14 June 1, 2020, and each year thereafter,\\n15 the projected capacity price shall be\\n16 equal to the sum of (1) 50% multiplied by\\n17 the Base Residual Auction, or its\\n18 successor, price for the ComEd zone as\\n19 determined by PJM Interconnection LLC,\\n20 divided by 24 hours per day, and (2) 50%\\n21 multiplied by the resource auction price\\n22 determined in the resource auction\\n23 administered by the Midcontinent\\n24 Independent System Operator, Inc., in\\n25 which the largest percentage of load\\n26 cleared for Local Resource Zone 4, dividedHB0804 - 392 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 by 24 hours per day, and where such price\\n2 is determined by the Midcontinent\\n3 Independent System Operator, Inc.\\n4 For purposes of this subsection (d-5):\\n5 \"Rest of the RTO\" and \"ComEd Zone\" shall have\\n6 the meaning ascribed to them by PJM\\n7 Interconnection, LLC.\\n8 \"RTO\" means regional transmission\\n9 organization.\\n10 (C) No later than 45 days after June 1, 2017 (the\\n11 effective date of Public Act 99-906), the Agency shall\\n12 publish its proposed zero emission standard\\n13 procurement plan. The plan shall be consistent with\\n14 the provisions of this paragraph (1) and shall provide\\n15 that winning bids shall be selected based on public\\n16 interest criteria that include, but are not limited\\n17 to, minimizing carbon dioxide emissions that result\\n18 from electricity consumed in Illinois and minimizing\\n19 sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter\\n20 emissions that adversely affect the residents citizens\\n21 of this State. In particular, the selection of winning\\n22 bids shall take into account the incremental\\n23 environmental benefits resulting from the procurement,\\n24 such as any existing environmental benefits that are\\n25 preserved by the procurements held under Public Act\\n26 99-906 and would cease to exist if the procurementsHB0804 - 393 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 were not held, including the preservation of zero\\n2 emission facilities. The plan shall also describe in\\n3 detail how each public interest factor shall be\\n4 considered and weighted in the bid selection process\\n5 to ensure that the public interest criteria are\\n6 applied to the procurement and given full effect.\\n7 For purposes of developing the plan, the Agency\\n8 shall consider any reports issued by a State agency,\\n9 board, or commission under House Resolution 1146 of\\n10 the 98th General Assembly and paragraph (4) of\\n11 subsection (d) of this Section, as well as publicly\\n12 available analyses and studies performed by or for\\n13 regional transmission organizations that serve the\\n14 State and their independent market monitors.\\n15 Upon publishing of the zero emission standard\\n16 procurement plan, copies of the plan shall be posted\\n17 and made publicly available on the Agency\\'s website.\\n18 All interested parties shall have 10 days following\\n19 the date of posting to provide comment to the Agency on\\n20 the plan. All comments shall be posted to the Agency\\'s\\n21 website. Following the end of the comment period, but\\n22 no more than 60 days later than June 1, 2017 (the\\n23 effective date of Public Act 99-906), the Agency shall\\n24 revise the plan as necessary based on the comments\\n25 received and file its zero emission standard\\n26 procurement plan with the Commission.HB0804 - 394 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 If the Commission determines that the plan will\\n2 result in the procurement of cost-effective zero\\n3 emission credits, then the Commission shall, after\\n4 notice and hearing, but no later than 45 days after the\\n5 Agency filed the plan, approve the plan or approve\\n6 with modification. For purposes of this subsection\\n7 (d-5), \"cost effective\" means the projected costs of\\n8 procuring zero emission credits from zero emission\\n9 facilities do not cause the limit stated in paragraph\\n10 (2) of this subsection to be exceeded.\\n11 (C-5) As part of the Commission\\'s review and\\n12 acceptance or rejection of the procurement results,\\n13 the Commission shall, in its public notice of\\n14 successful bidders:\\n15 (i) identify how the winning bids satisfy the\\n16 public interest criteria described in subparagraph\\n17 (C) of this paragraph (1) of minimizing carbon\\n18 dioxide emissions that result from electricity\\n19 consumed in Illinois and minimizing sulfur\\n20 dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter\\n21 emissions that adversely affect the residents\\n22 citizens of this State;\\n23 (ii) specifically address how the selection of\\n24 winning bids takes into account the incremental\\n25 environmental benefits resulting from the\\n26 procurement, including any existing environmentalHB0804 - 395 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 benefits that are preserved by the procurements\\n2 held under Public Act 99-906 and would have ceased\\n3 to exist if the procurements had not been held,\\n4 such as the preservation of zero emission\\n5 facilities;\\n6 (iii) quantify the environmental benefit of\\n7 preserving the resources identified in item (ii)\\n8 of this subparagraph (C-5), including the\\n9 following:\\n10 (aa) the value of avoided greenhouse gas\\n11 emissions measured as the product of the zero\\n12 emission facilities\\' output over the contract\\n13 term multiplied by the U.S. Environmental\\n14 Protection Agency eGrid subregion carbon\\n15 dioxide emission rate and the U.S. Interagency\\n16 Working Group on Social Cost of Carbon\\'s price\\n17 in the August 2016 Technical Update using a 3%\\n18 discount rate, adjusted for inflation for each\\n19 delivery year; and\\n20 (bb) the costs of replacement with other\\n21 zero carbon dioxide resources, including wind\\n22 and photovoltaic, based upon the simple\\n23 average of the following:\\n24 (I) the price, or if there is more\\n25 than one price, the average of the prices,\\n26 paid for renewable energy credits from newHB0804 - 396 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 utility-scale wind projects in the\\n2 procurement events specified in item (i)\\n3 of subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1) of\\n4 subsection (c) of this Section; and\\n5 (II) the price, or if there is more\\n6 than one price, the average of the prices,\\n7 paid for renewable energy credits from new\\n8 utility-scale solar projects and\\n9 brownfield site photovoltaic projects in\\n10 the procurement events specified in item\\n11 (ii) of subparagraph (G) of paragraph (1)\\n12 of subsection (c) of this Section and,\\n13 after January 1, 2015, renewable energy\\n14 credits from photovoltaic distributed\\n15 generation projects in procurement events\\n16 held under subsection (c) of this Section.\\n17 Each utility shall enter into binding contractual\\n18 arrangements with the winning suppliers.\\n19 The procurement described in this subsection\\n20 (d-5), including, but not limited to, the execution of\\n21 all contracts procured, shall be completed no later\\n22 than May 10, 2017. Based on the effective date of\\n23 Public Act 99-906, the Agency and Commission may, as\\n24 appropriate, modify the various dates and timelines\\n25 under this subparagraph and subparagraphs (C) and (D)\\n26 of this paragraph (1). The procurement and planHB0804 - 397 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 approval processes required by this subsection (d-5)\\n2 shall be conducted in conjunction with the procurement\\n3 and plan approval processes required by subsection (c)\\n4 of this Section and Section 16-111.5 of the Public\\n5 Utilities Act, to the extent practicable.\\n6 Notwithstanding whether a procurement event is\\n7 conducted under Section 16-111.5 of the Public\\n8 Utilities Act, the Agency shall immediately initiate a\\n9 procurement process on June 1, 2017 (the effective\\n10 date of Public Act 99-906).\\n11 (D) Following the procurement event described in\\n12 this paragraph (1) and consistent with subparagraph\\n13 (B) of this paragraph (1), the Agency shall calculate\\n14 the payments to be made under each contract for the\\n15 next delivery year based on the market price index for\\n16 that delivery year. The Agency shall publish the\\n17 payment calculations no later than May 25, 2017 and\\n18 every May 25 thereafter.\\n19 (E) Notwithstanding the requirements of this\\n20 subsection (d-5), the contracts executed under this\\n21 subsection (d-5) shall provide that the zero emission\\n22 facility may, as applicable, suspend or terminate\\n23 performance under the contracts in the following\\n24 instances:\\n25 (i) A zero emission facility shall be excused\\n26 from its performance under the contract for anyHB0804 - 398 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 cause beyond the control of the resource,\\n2 including, but not restricted to, acts of God,\\n3 flood, drought, earthquake, storm, fire,\\n4 lightning, epidemic, war, riot, civil disturbance\\n5 or disobedience, labor dispute, labor or material\\n6 shortage, sabotage, acts of public enemy,\\n7 explosions, orders, regulations or restrictions\\n8 imposed by governmental, military, or lawfully\\n9 established civilian authorities, which, in any of\\n10 the foregoing cases, by exercise of commercially\\n11 reasonable efforts the zero emission facility\\n12 could not reasonably have been expected to avoid,\\n13 and which, by the exercise of commercially\\n14 reasonable efforts, it has been unable to\\n15 overcome. In such event, the zero emission\\n16 facility shall be excused from performance for the\\n17 duration of the event, including, but not limited\\n18 to, delivery of zero emission credits, and no\\n19 payment shall be due to the zero emission facility\\n20 during the duration of the event.\\n21 (ii) A zero emission facility shall be\\n22 permitted to terminate the contract if legislation\\n23 is enacted into law by the General Assembly that\\n24 imposes or authorizes a new tax, special\\n25 assessment, or fee on the generation of\\n26 electricity, the ownership or leasehold of aHB0804 - 399 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 generating unit, or the privilege or occupation of\\n2 such generation, ownership, or leasehold of\\n3 generation units by a zero emission facility.\\n4 However, the provisions of this item (ii) do not\\n5 apply to any generally applicable tax, special\\n6 assessment or fee, or requirements imposed by\\n7 federal law.\\n8 (iii) A zero emission facility shall be\\n9 permitted to terminate the contract in the event\\n10 that the resource requires capital expenditures in\\n11 excess of $40,000,000 that were neither known nor\\n12 reasonably foreseeable at the time it executed the\\n13 contract and that a prudent owner or operator of\\n14 such resource would not undertake.\\n15 (iv) A zero emission facility shall be\\n16 permitted to terminate the contract in the event\\n17 the Nuclear Regulatory Commission terminates the\\n18 resource\\'s license.\\n19 (F) If the zero emission facility elects to\\n20 terminate a contract under subparagraph (E) of this\\n21 paragraph (1), then the Commission shall reopen the\\n22 docket in which the Commission approved the zero\\n23 emission standard procurement plan under subparagraph\\n24 (C) of this paragraph (1) and, after notice and\\n25 hearing, enter an order acknowledging the contract\\n26 termination election if such termination is consistentHB0804 - 400 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 with the provisions of this subsection (d-5).\\n2 (2) For purposes of this subsection (d-5), the amount\\n3 paid per kilowatthour means the total amount paid for\\n4 electric service expressed on a per kilowatthour basis.\\n5 For purposes of this subsection (d-5), the total amount\\n6 paid for electric service includes, without limitation,\\n7 amounts paid for supply, transmission, distribution,\\n8 surcharges, and add-on taxes.\\n9 Notwithstanding the requirements of this subsection\\n10 (d-5), the contracts executed under this subsection (d-5)\\n11 shall provide that the total of zero emission credits\\n12 procured under a procurement plan shall be subject to the\\n13 limitations of this paragraph (2). For each delivery year,\\n14 the contractual volume receiving payments in such year\\n15 shall be reduced for all retail customers based on the\\n16 amount necessary to limit the net increase that delivery\\n17 year to the costs of those credits included in the amounts\\n18 paid by eligible retail customers in connection with\\n19 electric service to no more than 1.65% of the amount paid\\n20 per kilowatthour by eligible retail customers during the\\n21 year ending May 31, 2009. The result of this computation\\n22 shall apply to and reduce the procurement for all retail\\n23 customers, and all those customers shall pay the same\\n24 single, uniform cents per kilowatthour charge under\\n25 subsection (k) of Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities\\n26 Act. To arrive at a maximum dollar amount of zero emissionHB0804 - 401 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 credits to be paid for the particular delivery year, the\\n2 resulting per kilowatthour amount shall be applied to the\\n3 actual amount of kilowatthours of electricity delivered by\\n4 the electric utility in the delivery year immediately\\n5 prior to the procurement, to all retail customers in its\\n6 service territory. Unpaid contractual volume for any\\n7 delivery year shall be paid in any subsequent delivery\\n8 year in which such payments can be made without exceeding\\n9 the amount specified in this paragraph (2). The\\n10 calculations required by this paragraph (2) shall be made\\n11 only once for each procurement plan year. Once the\\n12 determination as to the amount of zero emission credits to\\n13 be paid is made based on the calculations set forth in this\\n14 paragraph (2), no subsequent rate impact determinations\\n15 shall be made and no adjustments to those contract amounts\\n16 shall be allowed. All costs incurred under those contracts\\n17 and in implementing this subsection (d-5) shall be\\n18 recovered by the electric utility as provided in this\\n19 Section.\\n20 No later than June 30, 2019, the Commission shall\\n21 review the limitation on the amount of zero emission\\n22 credits procured under this subsection (d-5) and report to\\n23 the General Assembly its findings as to whether that\\n24 limitation unduly constrains the procurement of\\n25 cost-effective zero emission credits.\\n26 (3) Six years after the execution of a contract underHB0804 - 402 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 this subsection (d-5), the Agency shall determine whether\\n2 the actual zero emission credit payments received by the\\n3 supplier over the 6-year period exceed the Average ZEC\\n4 Payment. In addition, at the end of the term of a contract\\n5 executed under this subsection (d-5), or at the time, if\\n6 any, a zero emission facility\\'s contract is terminated\\n7 under subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of this subsection\\n8 (d-5), then the Agency shall determine whether the actual\\n9 zero emission credit payments received by the supplier\\n10 over the term of the contract exceed the Average ZEC\\n11 Payment, after taking into account any amounts previously\\n12 credited back to the utility under this paragraph (3). If\\n13 the Agency determines that the actual zero emission credit\\n14 payments received by the supplier over the relevant period\\n15 exceed the Average ZEC Payment, then the supplier shall\\n16 credit the difference back to the utility. The amount of\\n17 the credit shall be remitted to the applicable electric\\n18 utility no later than 120 days after the Agency\\'s\\n19 determination, which the utility shall reflect as a credit\\n20 on its retail customer bills as soon as practicable;\\n21 however, the credit remitted to the utility shall not\\n22 exceed the total amount of payments received by the\\n23 facility under its contract.\\n24 For purposes of this Section, the Average ZEC Payment\\n25 shall be calculated by multiplying the quantity of zero\\n26 emission credits delivered under the contract times theHB0804 - 403 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 average contract price. The average contract price shall\\n2 be determined by subtracting the amount calculated under\\n3 subparagraph (B) of this paragraph (3) from the amount\\n4 calculated under subparagraph (A) of this paragraph (3),\\n5 as follows:\\n6 (A) The average of the Social Cost of Carbon, as\\n7 defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this\\n8 subsection (d-5), during the term of the contract.\\n9 (B) The average of the market price indices, as\\n10 defined in subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this\\n11 subsection (d-5), during the term of the contract,\\n12 minus the baseline market price index, as defined in\\n13 subparagraph (B) of paragraph (1) of this subsection\\n14 (d-5).\\n15 If the subtraction yields a negative number, then the\\n16 Average ZEC Payment shall be zero.\\n17 (4) Cost-effective zero emission credits procured from\\n18 zero emission facilities shall satisfy the applicable\\n19 definitions set forth in Section 1-10 of this Act.\\n20 (5) The electric utility shall retire all zero\\n21 emission credits used to comply with the requirements of\\n22 this subsection (d-5).\\n23 (6) Electric utilities shall be entitled to recover\\n24 all of the costs associated with the procurement of zero\\n25 emission credits through an automatic adjustment clause\\n26 tariff in accordance with subsection (k) and (m) ofHB0804 - 404 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Section 16-108 of the Public Utilities Act, and the\\n2 contracts executed under this subsection (d-5) shall\\n3 provide that the utilities\\' payment obligations under such\\n4 contracts shall be reduced if an adjustment is required\\n5 under subsection (m) of Section 16-108 of the Public\\n6 Utilities Act.\\n7 (7) This subsection (d-5) shall become inoperative on\\n8 January 1, 2028.\\n9 (e) The draft procurement plans are subject to public\\n10 comment, as required by Section 16-111.5 of the Public\\n11 Utilities Act.\\n12 (f) The Agency shall submit the final procurement plan to\\n13 the Commission. The Agency shall revise a procurement plan if\\n14 the Commission determines that it does not meet the standards\\n15 set forth in Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act.\\n16 (g) The Agency shall assess fees to each affected utility\\n17 to recover the costs incurred in preparation of the annual\\n18 procurement plan for the utility.\\n19 (h) The Agency shall assess fees to each bidder to recover\\n20 the costs incurred in connection with a competitive\\n21 procurement process.\\n22 (i) A renewable energy credit, carbon emission credit, or\\n23 zero emission credit can only be used once to comply with a\\n24 single portfolio or other standard as set forth in subsection\\n25 (c), subsection (d), or subsection (d-5) of this Section,\\n26 respectively. A renewable energy credit, carbon emissionHB0804 - 405 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 credit, or zero emission credit cannot be used to satisfy the\\n2 requirements of more than one standard. If more than one type\\n3 of credit is issued for the same megawatt hour of energy, only\\n4 one credit can be used to satisfy the requirements of a single\\n5 standard. After such use, the credit must be retired together\\n6 with any other credits issued for the same megawatt hour of\\n7 energy.\\n8 (j) Renewable energy supply.\\n9 (1) Beginning with the energy to be delivered in the\\n10 delivery year commencing on June 1, 2023, the Agency shall\\n11 assess the feasibility of procuring cost-effective,\\n12 long-term contracts for energy supply from renewable\\n13 energy projects, in accordance with the requirements of\\n14 Section 16-111.5 of the Public Utilities Act for the\\n15 eligible retail customers of electric utilities that on\\n16 December 31, 2005 provided electric service to at least\\n17 100,000 customers in Illinois.\\n18 (2) Long-term contracts as described in this\\n19 subsection (j) shall refer to contracts that are\\n20 preferably no less than a 15-year period, but in no case\\n21 less than a 5-year period.\\n22 (3) The Agency shall evaluate energy supply\\n23 procurements that enable greater achievement, or more\\n24 cost-effective achievement, of the renewable energy goals\\n25 in this Section, including through coordination or\\n26 bundling with procurements of renewable energy credits, orHB0804 - 406 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 capacity from renewable energy resources, as provided\\n2 under subparagraph (P) of subsection (c) of this Section,\\n3 or capacity from renewable energy resources, as provided\\n4 under subsection (k) of this Section.\\n5 (4) The Agency shall include in its annual procurement\\n6 plan the results of this assessment and any recommended\\n7 procurements. The Agency shall, at a minimum, reevaluate\\n8 its assessment every 3 years, incorporating new\\n9 information from updated data, including, but not limited\\n10 to, the results of its procurements, competitive market\\n11 trends, and energy procurements in other states.\\n12 (k) Capacity procurement.\\n13 (1) This Section grants the Illinois Power Agency the\\n14 sole authority to conduct auctions for the purpose of\\n15 procuring capacity if a public utility in the State elects\\n16 to use the Fixed Resource Requirement Alternative as\\n17 provided for in the Open Access Transmission Tariff,\\n18 Reliability Assurance Agreement, and manuals of PJM\\n19 Interconnection, LLC or its successors, and that election\\n20 is approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission. Where the\\n21 election is approved by the Illinois Commerce Commission,\\n22 the Illinois Power Agency shall develop a procurement plan\\n23 for the procurement of capacity in amounts necessary to\\n24 ensure the public utility\\'s resource adequacy pursuant to\\n25 PJM\\'s federally-mandated requirements. The Agency is\\n26 authorized to conduct Capacity Procurement auctions asHB0804 - 407 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 necessary to meet the public utility\\'s resource\\n2 obligations while achieving the objectives set forth in\\n3 this Section for the duration of the public utility\\'s\\n4 election of the Fixed Resource Requirement Alternative.\\n5 (2) The draft procurement plan is subject to public\\n6 comment, as required by Section 16-111.5 of the Public\\n7 Utilities Act.\\n8 (3) The Agency shall design the Capacity Procurement\\n9 Plan to achieve the following objectives:\\n10 (i) Through one or more auctions which procure\\n11 capacity for one or more years, meets the public\\n12 utility\\'s resource obligation under the Fixed Resource\\n13 Requirement Alternative while maximizing benefits that\\n14 meet the State\\'s public interest in the health, safety\\n15 and welfare of its residents, including, but not\\n16 limited to: significantly reduced emissions in the\\n17 State from power generation sources; consumer savings;\\n18 and those interests described in subparagraph (I) of\\n19 paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the\\n20 Illinois Power Agency Act.\\n21 (ii) Implements a limiter on auction payments to\\n22 all resources that are not renewable energy resources,\\n23 demand response, or energy efficiency resources. The\\n24 limiter shall be imposed on all other resources such\\n25 that total payments under the auction ensure consumer\\n26 savings at an amount no less than 5% below a baselineHB0804 - 408 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 of previous years\\' payments.\\n2 (iii) Implements a limiter on participating\\n3 carbon-emitting resources such that emissions decrease\\n4 below a baseline of previous years\\' emissions.\\n5 (4) As part of its Capacity Procurement plans, the\\n6 Agency may implement an auction for an optional bundled\\n7 product which includes payments to resources that provide\\n8 both capacity and renewable energy credits. Renewable\\n9 energy resources that are not eligible to participate in\\n10 auctions pursuant to subparagraph (J) of paragraph (1) of\\n11 subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power\\n12 Agency Act are not eligible to participate in auctions\\n13 conducted to implement Capacity Procurement plans.\\n14 (Source: P.A. 100-863, eff. 8-14-18; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19;\\n15 101-113, eff. 1-1-20.)\\n16 Section 90-20.

For tax years ending on or after\\n19 December 31, 1987, and on or before December 31, 1988, the\\n20 credit shall be allowed for the tax year in which the\\n21 property is placed in service, or, if the amount of the\\n22 credit exceeds the tax liability for that year, whether it\\n23 exceeds the original liability or the liability as later\\n24 amended, such excess may be carried forward and applied to\\n25 the tax liability of the 5 taxable years following the\\n26 excess credit years if the taxpayer (i) makes investmentsHB0804 - 420 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 which cause the creation of a minimum of 2,000 full-time\\n2 equivalent jobs in Illinois, (ii) is located in an\\n3 enterprise zone established pursuant to the Illinois\\n4 Enterprise Zone Act and (iii) is certified by the\\n5 Department of Commerce and Community Affairs (now\\n6 Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity) as\\n7 complying with the requirements specified in clause (i)\\n8 and (ii) by July 1, 1986. The Department of Commerce and\\n9 Community Affairs (now Department of Commerce and Economic\\n10 Opportunity) shall notify the Department of Revenue of all\\n11 such certifications immediately. For tax years ending\\n12 after December 31, 1988, the credit shall be allowed for\\n13 the tax year in which the property is placed in service,\\n14 or, if the amount of the credit exceeds the tax liability\\n15 for that year, whether it exceeds the original liability\\n16 or the liability as later amended, such excess may be\\n17 carried forward and applied to the tax liability of the 5\\n18 taxable years following the excess credit years. The\\n19 credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which\\n20 there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one\\n21 tax year that is available to offset a liability, earlier\\n22 credit shall be applied first.\\n23 (2) The term \"qualified property\" means property\\n24 which:\\n25 (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including\\n26 buildings and structural components of buildings andHB0804 - 421 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 signs that are real property, but not including land\\n2 or improvements to real property that are not a\\n3 structural component of a building such as\\n4 landscaping, sewer lines, local access roads, fencing,\\n5 parking lots, and other appurtenances;\\n6 (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the\\n7 Internal Revenue Code, except that \"3-year property\"\\n8 as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not\\n9 eligible for the credit provided by this subsection\\n10 (e);\\n11 (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section\\n12 179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;\\n13 (D) is used in Illinois by a taxpayer who is\\n14 primarily engaged in manufacturing, or in mining coal\\n15 or fluorite, or in retailing, or was placed in service\\n16 on or after July 1, 2006 in a River Edge Redevelopment\\n17 Zone established pursuant to the River Edge\\n18 Redevelopment Zone Act; and\\n19 (E) has not previously been used in Illinois in\\n20 such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for\\n21 the credit provided by this subsection (e) or\\n22 subsection (f).\\n23 (3) For purposes of this subsection (e),\\n24 \"manufacturing\" means the material staging and production\\n25 of tangible personal property by procedures commonly\\n26 regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, orHB0804 - 422 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 assembling which changes some existing material into new\\n2 shapes, new qualities, or new combinations.

Such increase shall be determined by\\n7 (i) recomputing the investment credit which would have\\n8 been allowed for the year in which credit for such\\n9 property was originally allowed by eliminating such\\n10 property from such computation and, (ii) subtracting such\\n11 recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously\\n12 allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (7), a\\n13 reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting\\n14 from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be\\n15 deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent\\n16 of such reduction.\\n17 (8) Unless the investment credit is extended by law,\\n18 the basis of qualified property shall not include costs\\n19 incurred after December 31, 2018, except for costs\\n20 incurred pursuant to a binding contract entered into on or\\n21 before December 31, 2018.\\n22 (9) Each taxable year ending before December 31, 2000,\\n23 a partnership may elect to pass through to its partners\\n24 the credits to which the partnership is entitled under\\n25 this subsection (e) for the taxable year.

If the partnership makes that\\n3 election, those credits shall be allocated among the\\n4 partners in the partnership in accordance with the rules\\n5 set forth in Section 704(b) of the Internal Revenue Code,\\n6 and the rules promulgated under that Section, and the\\n7 allocated amount of the credits shall be allowed to the\\n8 partners for that taxable year.

The credit shall be available\\n19 only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in\\n20 service in the Enterprise Zone or River Edge Redevelopment\\n21 Zone and shall not be allowed to the extent that it would\\n22 reduce a taxpayer\\'s liability for the tax imposed by\\n23 subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. For\\n24 tax years ending on or after December 31, 1985, the credit\\n25 shall be allowed for the tax year in which the property is\\n26 placed in service, or, if the amount of the credit exceedsHB0804 - 426 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the tax liability for that year, whether it exceeds the\\n2 original liability or the liability as later amended, such\\n3 excess may be carried forward and applied to the tax\\n4 liability of the 5 taxable years following the excess\\n5 credit year. The credit shall be applied to the earliest\\n6 year for which there is a liability.

For the purposes of this paragraph (6), a\\n25 reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting\\n26 from a redetermination of the purchase price shall beHB0804 - 428 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent\\n2 of such reduction.\\n3 (7) There shall be allowed an additional credit equal\\n4 to 0.5% of the basis of qualified property placed in\\n5 service during the taxable year in a River Edge\\n6 Redevelopment Zone, provided such property is placed in\\n7 service on or after July 1, 2006, and the taxpayer\\'s base\\n8 employment within Illinois has increased by 1% or more\\n9 over the preceding year as determined by the taxpayer\\'s\\n10 employment records filed with the Illinois Department of\\n11 Employment Security. Taxpayers who are new to Illinois\\n12 shall be deemed to have met the 1% growth in base\\n13 employment for the first year in which they file\\n14 employment records with the Illinois Department of\\n15 Employment Security. If, in any year, the increase in base\\n16 employment within Illinois over the preceding year is less\\n17 than 1%, the additional credit shall be limited to that\\n18 percentage times a fraction, the numerator of which is\\n19 0.5% and the denominator of which is 1%, but shall not\\n20 exceed 0.5%.\\n21 (8) For taxable years beginning on or after January 1,\\n22 2021, there shall be allowed an Enterprise Zone\\n23 construction jobs credit against the taxes imposed under\\n24 subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as provided in\\n25 Section 13 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act.\\n26 The credit or credits may not reduce the taxpayer\\'sHB0804 - 429 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 liability to less than zero.

The credit shall not be available (i) until the\\n9 minimum investments in qualified property set forth in\\n10 subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois\\n11 Enterprise Zone Act have been satisfied or (ii) until the\\n12 time authorized in subsection (b-5) of the Illinois\\n13 Enterprise Zone Act for entities designated as High Impact\\n14 Businesses under subdivisions (a)(3)(B), (a)(3)(C), and\\n15 (a)(3)(D) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone\\n16 Act, and shall not be allowed to the extent that it would\\n17 reduce a taxpayer\\'s liability for the tax imposed by\\n18 subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. The\\n19 credit applicable to such investments shall be taken in\\n20 the taxable year in which such investments have been\\n21 completed. The credit for additional investments beyond\\n22 the minimum investment by a designated high impact\\n23 business authorized under subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section\\n24 5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act shall be available\\n25 only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in\\n26 service and shall not be allowed to the extent that itHB0804 - 431 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 would reduce a taxpayer\\'s liability for the tax imposed by\\n2 subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero. For\\n3 tax years ending on or after December 31, 1987, the credit\\n4 shall be allowed for the tax year in which the property is\\n5 placed in service, or, if the amount of the credit exceeds\\n6 the tax liability for that year, whether it exceeds the\\n7 original liability or the liability as later amended, such\\n8 excess may be carried forward and applied to the tax\\n9 liability of the 5 taxable years following the excess\\n10 credit year. The credit shall be applied to the earliest\\n11 year for which there is a liability. If there is credit\\n12 from more than one tax year that is available to offset a\\n13 liability, the credit accruing first in time shall be\\n14 applied first.\\n15 Changes made in this subdivision (h)(1) by Public Act\\n16 88-670 restore changes made by Public Act 85-1182 and\\n17 reflect existing law.\\n18 (2) The term qualified property means property which:\\n19 (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including\\n20 buildings and structural components of buildings;\\n21 (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the\\n22 Internal Revenue Code, except that \"3-year property\"\\n23 as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not\\n24 eligible for the credit provided by this subsection\\n25 (h);\\n26 (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in SectionHB0804 - 432 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code; and\\n2 (D) is not eligible for the Enterprise Zone\\n3 Investment Credit provided by subsection (f) of this\\n4 Section.\\n5 (3) The basis of qualified property shall be the basis\\n6 used to compute the depreciation deduction for federal\\n7 income tax purposes.\\n8 (4) If the basis of the property for federal income\\n9 tax depreciation purposes is increased after it has been\\n10 placed in service in a federally designated Foreign Trade\\n11 Zone or Sub-Zone located in Illinois by the taxpayer, the\\n12 amount of such increase shall be deemed property placed in\\n13 service on the date of such increase in basis.\\n14 (5) The term \"placed in service\" shall have the same\\n15 meaning as under Section 46 of the Internal Revenue Code.\\n16 (6) If during any taxable year ending on or before\\n17 December 31, 1996, any property ceases to be qualified\\n18 property in the hands of the taxpayer within 48 months\\n19 after being placed in service, or the situs of any\\n20 qualified property is moved outside Illinois within 48\\n21 months after being placed in service, the tax imposed\\n22 under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section for such\\n23 taxable year shall be increased. Such increase shall be\\n24 determined by (i) recomputing the investment credit which\\n25 would have been allowed for the year in which credit for\\n26 such property was originally allowed by eliminating suchHB0804 - 433 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 property from such computation, and (ii) subtracting such\\n2 recomputed credit from the amount of credit previously\\n3 allowed. For the purposes of this paragraph (6), a\\n4 reduction of the basis of qualified property resulting\\n5 from a redetermination of the purchase price shall be\\n6 deemed a disposition of qualified property to the extent\\n7 of such reduction.\\n8 (7) Beginning with tax years ending after December 31,\\n9 1996, if a taxpayer qualifies for the credit under this\\n10 subsection (h) and thereby is granted a tax abatement and\\n11 the taxpayer relocates its entire facility in violation of\\n12 the explicit terms and length of the contract under\\n13 Section 18-183 of the Property Tax Code, the tax imposed\\n14 under subsections (a) and (b) of this Section shall be\\n15 increased for the taxable year in which the taxpayer\\n16 relocated its facility by an amount equal to the amount of\\n17 credit received by the taxpayer under this subsection (h).\\n18 (h-5) High Impact Business construction constructions jobs\\n19 credit. For taxable years beginning on or after January 1,\\n20 2021, there shall also be allowed a High Impact Business\\n21 construction jobs credit against the tax imposed under\\n22 subsections (a) and (b) of this Section as provided in\\n23 subsections (i) and (j) of Section 5.5 of the Illinois\\n24 Enterprise Zone Act.\\n25 The credit or credits may not reduce the taxpayer\\'s\\n26 liability to less than zero. If the amount of the credit orHB0804 - 434 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 credits exceeds the taxpayer\\'s liability, the excess may be\\n2 carried forward and applied against the taxpayer\\'s liability\\n3 in succeeding calendar years in the manner provided under\\n4 paragraph (4) of Section 211 of this Act. The credit or credits\\n5 shall be applied to the earliest year for which there is a tax\\n6 liability. If there are credits from more than one taxable\\n7 year that are available to offset a liability, the earlier\\n8 credit shall be applied first.\\n9 For partners, shareholders of Subchapter S corporations,\\n10 and owners of limited liability companies, if the liability\\n11 company is treated as a partnership for the purposes of\\n12 federal and State income taxation, there shall be allowed a\\n13 credit under this Section to be determined in accordance with\\n14 the determination of income and distributive share of income\\n15 under Sections 702 and 704 and Subchapter S of the Internal\\n16 Revenue Code.\\n17 The total aggregate amount of credits awarded under the\\n18 Blue Collar Jobs Act (Article 20 of Public Act 101-9 this\\n19 amendatory Act of the 101st General Assembly) shall not exceed\\n20 $20,000,000 in any State fiscal year.\\n21 This subsection (h-5) is exempt from the provisions of\\n22 Section 250.\\n23 (i) Credit for Personal Property Tax Replacement Income\\n24 Tax.

This credit shall be computed by\\n2 multiplying the tax imposed by subsections (c) and (d) of this\\n3 Section by a fraction, the numerator of which is base income\\n4 allocable to Illinois and the denominator of which is Illinois\\n5 base income, and further multiplying the product by the tax\\n6 rate imposed by subsections (a) and (b) of this Section.\\n7 Any credit earned on or after December 31, 1986 under this\\n8 subsection which is unused in the year the credit is computed\\n9 because it exceeds the tax liability imposed by subsections\\n10 (a) and (b) for that year (whether it exceeds the original\\n11 liability or the liability as later amended) may be carried\\n12 forward and applied to the tax liability imposed by\\n13 subsections (a) and (b) of the 5 taxable years following the\\n14 excess credit year, provided that no credit may be carried\\n15 forward to any year ending on or after December 31, 2003.

Such reduction shall be determined by\\n26 recomputing the credit to take into account the reduced taxHB0804 - 436 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 imposed by subsections (c) and (d). If any portion of the\\n2 reduced amount of credit has been carried to a different\\n3 taxable year, an amended return shall be filed for such\\n4 taxable year to reduce the amount of credit claimed.\\n5 (j) Training expense credit. Beginning with tax years\\n6 ending on or after December 31, 1986 and prior to December 31,\\n7 2003, a taxpayer shall be allowed a credit against the tax\\n8 imposed by subsections (a) and (b) under this Section for all\\n9 amounts paid or accrued, on behalf of all persons employed by\\n10 the taxpayer in Illinois or Illinois residents employed\\n11 outside of Illinois by a taxpayer, for educational or\\n12 vocational training in semi-technical or technical fields or\\n13 semi-skilled or skilled fields, which were deducted from gross\\n14 income in the computation of taxable income.

This credit shall be\\n2 applied first to the earliest year for which there is a\\n3 liability. If there is a credit under this subsection from\\n4 more than one tax year that is available to offset a liability,\\n5 the earliest credit arising under this subsection shall be\\n6 applied first. No carryforward credit may be claimed in any\\n7 tax year ending on or after December 31, 2003.\\n8 (k) Research and development credit. For tax years ending\\n9 after July 1, 1990 and prior to December 31, 2003, and\\n10 beginning again for tax years ending on or after December 31,\\n11 2004, and ending prior to January 1, 2027, a taxpayer shall be\\n12 allowed a credit against the tax imposed by subsections (a)\\n13 and (b) of this Section for increasing research activities in\\n14 this State. The credit allowed against the tax imposed by\\n15 subsections (a) and (b) shall be equal to 6 1/2% of the\\n16 qualifying expenditures for increasing research activities in\\n17 this State. For partners, shareholders of subchapter S\\n18 corporations, and owners of limited liability companies, if\\n19 the liability company is treated as a partnership for purposes\\n20 of federal and State income taxation, there shall be allowed a\\n21 credit under this subsection to be determined in accordance\\n22 with the determination of income and distributive share of\\n23 income under Sections 702 and 704 and subchapter S of the\\n24 Internal Revenue Code.\\n25 For purposes of this subsection, \"qualifying expenditures\"\\n26 means the qualifying expenditures as defined for the federalHB0804 - 438 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 credit for increasing research activities which would be\\n2 allowable under Section 41 of the Internal Revenue Code and\\n3 which are conducted in this State, \"qualifying expenditures\\n4 for increasing research activities in this State\" means the\\n5 excess of qualifying expenditures for the taxable year in\\n6 which incurred over qualifying expenditures for the base\\n7 period, \"qualifying expenditures for the base period\" means\\n8 the average of the qualifying expenditures for each year in\\n9 the base period, and \"base period\" means the 3 taxable years\\n10 immediately preceding the taxable year for which the\\n11 determination is being made.\\n12 Any credit in excess of the tax liability for the taxable\\n13 year may be carried forward.

If a tax liability for the given year still\\n24 remains, the credit from the next earliest year will then be\\n25 applied, and so on, until all credits have been used or no tax\\n26 liability for the given year remains. Any remaining unusedHB0804 - 439 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 credit or credits then will be carried forward to the next\\n2 following year in which a tax liability is incurred, except\\n3 that no credit can be carried forward to a year which is more\\n4 than 5 years after the year in which the expense for which the\\n5 credit is given was incurred.\\n6 No inference shall be drawn from Public Act 91-644 this\\n7 amendatory Act of the 91st General Assembly in construing this\\n8 Section for taxable years beginning before January 1, 1999.\\n9 It is the intent of the General Assembly that the research\\n10 and development credit under this subsection (k) shall apply\\n11 continuously for all tax years ending on or after December 31,\\n12 2004 and ending prior to January 1, 2027, including, but not\\n13 limited to, the period beginning on January 1, 2016 and ending\\n14 on July 6, 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 100-22) this\\n15 amendatory Act of the 100th General Assembly.

The\\n18 term \"unused credit\" does not include any amounts of\\n19 unreimbursed eligible remediation costs in excess of the\\n20 maximum credit per site authorized under paragraph (i).\\n21 This credit shall be applied first to the earliest year\\n22 for which there is a liability. If there is a credit under\\n23 this subsection from more than one tax year that is\\n24 available to offset a liability, the earliest credit\\n25 arising under this subsection shall be applied first. A\\n26 credit allowed under this subsection may be sold to aHB0804 - 442 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 buyer as part of a sale of all or part of the remediation\\n2 site for which the credit was granted. The purchaser of a\\n3 remediation site and the tax credit shall succeed to the\\n4 unused credit and remaining carry-forward period of the\\n5 seller. To perfect the transfer, the assignor shall record\\n6 the transfer in the chain of title for the site and provide\\n7 written notice to the Director of the Illinois Department\\n8 of Revenue of the assignor\\'s intent to sell the\\n9 remediation site and the amount of the tax credit to be\\n10 transferred as a portion of the sale. In no event may a\\n11 credit be transferred to any taxpayer if the taxpayer or a\\n12 related party would not be eligible under the provisions\\n13 of subsection (i).\\n14 (iii) For purposes of this Section, the term \"site\"\\n15 shall have the same meaning as under Section 58.2 of the\\n16 Environmental Protection Act.\\n17 (m) Education expense credit. Beginning with tax years\\n18 ending after December 31, 1999, a taxpayer who is the\\n19 custodian of one or more qualifying pupils shall be allowed a\\n20 credit against the tax imposed by subsections (a) and (b) of\\n21 this Section for qualified education expenses incurred on\\n22 behalf of the qualifying pupils.

Notwithstanding any other\\n4 provision of law, for taxable years beginning on or after\\n5 January 1, 2017, no taxpayer may claim a credit under this\\n6 subsection (m) if the taxpayer\\'s adjusted gross income for the\\n7 taxable year exceeds (i) $500,000, in the case of spouses\\n8 filing a joint federal tax return or (ii) $250,000, in the case\\n9 of all other taxpayers.

This\\n23 credit shall be applied first to the earliest year for\\n24 which there is a liability. If there is a credit under this\\n25 subsection from more than one tax year that is available\\n26 to offset a liability, the earliest credit arising underHB0804 - 446 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 this subsection shall be applied first.

The\\n6 credit shall be applied to the earliest year for which\\n7 there is a liability. If there is credit from more than one\\n8 tax year that is available to offset a liability, earlier\\n9 credit shall be applied first.\\n10 (2) The term \"qualified property\" means property\\n11 which:\\n12 (A) is tangible, whether new or used, including\\n13 buildings and structural components of buildings and\\n14 signs that are real property, but not including land\\n15 or improvements to real property that are not a\\n16 structural component of a building such as\\n17 landscaping, sewer lines, local access roads, fencing,\\n18 parking lots, and other appurtenances;\\n19 (B) is depreciable pursuant to Section 167 of the\\n20 Internal Revenue Code, except that \"3-year property\"\\n21 as defined in Section 168(c)(2)(A) of that Code is not\\n22 eligible for the credit provided by this subsection\\n23 (e);\\n24 (C) is acquired by purchase as defined in Section\\n25 179(d) of the Internal Revenue Code;\\n26 (D) is used in Illinois by a taxpayer who isHB0804 - 461 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 primarily engaged in manufacturing, or in mining coal\\n2 or fluorite, or in retailing, or was placed in service\\n3 on or after July 1, 2006 in a River Edge Redevelopment\\n4 Zone established pursuant to the River Edge\\n5 Redevelopment Zone Act; and\\n6 (E) has not previously been used in Illinois in\\n7 such a manner and by such a person as would qualify for\\n8 the credit provided by this subsection (e) or\\n9 subsection (f).\\n10 (3) For purposes of this subsection (e),\\n11 \"manufacturing\" means the material staging and production\\n12 of tangible personal property by procedures commonly\\n13 regarded as manufacturing, processing, fabrication, or\\n14 assembling which changes some existing material into new\\n15 shapes, new qualities, or new combinations. For purposes\\n16 of this subsection (e) the term \"mining\" shall have the\\n17 same meaning as the term \"mining\" in Section 613(c) of the\\n18 Internal Revenue Code. For purposes of this subsection\\n19 (e), the term \"retailing\" means the sale of tangible\\n20 personal property for use or consumption and not for\\n21 resale, or services rendered in conjunction with the sale\\n22 of tangible personal property for use or consumption and\\n23 not for resale.

The\\n8 credit applicable to such investments shall be taken in\\n9 the taxable year in which such investments have been\\n10 completed. The credit for additional investments beyond\\n11 the minimum investment by a designated high impact\\n12 business authorized under subdivision (a)(3)(A) of Section\\n13 5.5 of the Illinois Enterprise Zone Act shall be available\\n14 only in the taxable year in which the property is placed in\\n15 service and shall not be allowed to the extent that it\\n16 would reduce a taxpayer\\'s liability for the tax imposed by\\n17 subsections (a) and (b) of this Section to below zero.

Electric and natural gas public utilities\\n14 ethical conduct and transparency.\\n15 (a) It is the policy of this State that, as regulated,\\n16 monopoly entities providing essential services, public\\n17 utilities must adhere to the highest standards of ethical\\n18 conduct. Recent events have demonstrated that at least one\\n19 public utility in this State has not adhered to the standards\\n20 of conduct expected by the State, and as such, has failed to\\n21 ensure safe, reliable service for customers at reasonable,\\n22 affordable rates. The General Assembly finds this breach of\\n23 the public trust, which has resulted in unreasonable rates for\\n24 some public utility customers, to be exceptionally concerning.\\n25 (b) It is in the public interest to ensure ethical publicHB0804 - 493 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 utility conduct of the highest standards. It is therefore\\n2 necessary for the public interest, safety, and welfare of the\\n3 State and of public utility customers to develop rigorous\\n4 ethical standards with limitations on and heightened scrutiny\\n5 of public utility actions, expenditures and contracting, and\\n6 to provide increased transparency to ensure ethical public\\n7 utility conduct. The standards set forth in this Section and\\n8 in the Illinois Administrative Code rules implementing this\\n9 Section shall apply, to the extent practicable, to electric\\n10 and natural gas public utilities and their holding or parent\\n11 companies, affiliates, and service companies.

Independent monitors\\n5 shall:\\n6 (1) Work in coordination with the public utility\\'s\\n7 Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, as described in\\n8 subsection (e), to ensure the public utility complies with\\n9 the standards of conduct described in this Section, in the\\n10 Illinois Administrative Code, and any other applicable\\n11 authority, through investigation, enforcement, reporting,\\n12 and disciplinary activities.\\n13 (2) Document violations of the standards in this\\n14 Section or in related sections of the Illinois\\n15 Administrative Code and, in coordination with the\\n16 utility\\'s Chief Compliance and Ethics Officer, ensure\\n17 appropriate internal disciplinary actions and transparent\\n18 reporting to the Commission. In the event of violations of\\n19 the standards in this Section or in related sections of\\n20 the Illinois Administrative Code where the public utility\\n21 does not take disciplinary action, or where that action is\\n22 not aligned with the recommendation of the independent\\n23 monitor, the independent monitor shall, within 30 days,\\n24 report the violation, the independent monitor\\'s\\n25 recommended disciplinary action, and the public utility\\'s\\n26 actual disciplinary action, to the Public Utilities EthicsHB0804 - 496 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Inspector, who shall, within 30 days, file a report with\\n2 the Commission describing the violation and related\\n3 recommendations.\\n4 (3) Recommend to the public utility any new internal\\n5 controls, policies, practices or procedures the public\\n6 utility should undertake in order to ensure compliance\\n7 with this Section and with related sections of the\\n8 Illinois Administrative Code.\\n9 (4) At least annually, the independent monitor for a\\n10 public utility shall publish an ethics audit to be filed\\n11 with the Commission.

If internal\\n16 disciplinary actions were taken related to ethical conduct\\n17 governed by this Section or related Illinois\\n18 Administrative Code, the report shall also describe the\\n19 conduct and the responsive disciplinary actions taken. The\\n20 independent monitor shall also describe any\\n21 recommendations the independent monitor has made to the\\n22 public utility regarding standards of ethics, and the\\n23 public utility\\'s responses to those recommendations. The\\n24 report shall be made public and redactions shall be\\n25 limited to the maximum extent practicable.

Any such anticipated meetings shall be open to the\\n23 public and communicated to consumer, community, and\\n24 environmental advocates.\\n25 (ii) Communication between any director, officer,\\n26 employee, contractor, consultant, lobbyist, vendor, agent,HB0804 - 504 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 representative, or business partner of a public utility\\n2 and any Commissioner or employee of the Illinois Commerce\\n3 Commission on a topic or issue anticipated to be the\\n4 subject of a contested hearing within the next 365 days\\n5 shall be reported in a publicly available central\\n6 database.\\n7 (h) All reports from the Public Utilities Ethics Inspector\\n8 to the Commission shall be made public and redactions shall be\\n9 limited to the maximum extent practicable. Only information\\n10 which is critical to system security shall be redacted;\\n11 information in which the public utility claims a business\\n12 interest shall not be deemed confidential or redacted. The\\n13 Public Utilities Ethics Inspector shall establish a procedure\\n14 for making unredacted reports available to interested\\n15 stakeholders who establish good cause that receipt of an\\n16 unredacted report is in the public interest.\\n17 Adoption and implementation of these emergency rules is\\n18 deemed to be necessary for the public interest, safety, and\\n19 welfare.\\n20 (i) Noncompliance. In the event the Public Utility Ethics\\n21 Inspector finds a public utility does not comply with any\\n22 portion of this Section, or with the rules effectuated by this\\n23 Section, the Public Utility Ethics Inspector shall issue a\\n24 Report to the Commission detailing the public utility\\'s\\n25 deficiencies. The Commission shall have authority to open an\\n26 investigation and shall order remediation and penalties asHB0804 - 505 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 appropriate.\\n2 (j) Each year, each public utility in the State shall\\n3 remit amounts necessary for the State to pay the wages,\\n4 overhead, travel expenses, and other costs of that public\\n5 utility\\'s independent monitor as well as that public utility\\'s\\n6 proportional share, by number of customers, of the Public\\n7 Utility Ethics Inspector\\'s wages, overhead, travel expenses,\\n8 and other costs.

Restitution for misconduct.\\n22 (a) It is the policy of this State that public utility\\n23 ethical and criminal misconduct shall not be tolerated. The\\n24 General Assembly finds it necessary to collect restitution, to\\n25 be distributed as described in subsection (d), from a publicHB0804 - 506 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 utility who has been found guilty of violations of criminal\\n2 law or who has entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement\\n3 that details violations of criminal law.\\n4 (b) In light of such violations, the Illinois Commerce\\n5 Commission shall, within 150 days after the effective date of\\n6 this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, initiate an\\n7 investigation into amounts necessary to be refunded to\\n8 customers to restore funds to the State and to ratepayers that\\n9 were collected by the electric public utility Commonwealth\\n10 Edison Company as a result of ethical misconduct. The\\n11 investigation shall conclude no later than 270 days following\\n12 initiation, and shall be conducted as a contested proceeding.\\n13 The investigation shall calculate benefits received by the\\n14 public utility that were instituted as a result of illegal and\\n15 unethical conduct, as set forth in the Deferred Prosecution\\n16 Agreement of July 16, 2020 between the United States Attorney\\n17 for the Northern District of Illinois and Commonwealth Edison\\n18 Company, for passage of the Energy Infrastructure\\n19 Modernization Act of 2011. The amount shall be no less than the\\n20 total return on equity recovered for investments in\\n21 infrastructure made pursuant to paragraph (1) of subsection\\n22 (b) of Section 16-108.5 of this Act.\\n23 (c) Pursuant to subsection (d), the investigation shall\\n24 calculate a schedule for remittance to state funds and to\\n25 ratepayers, over a period of no more than 4 years, to be paid\\n26 by the public utility from profits, returns, or shareholderHB0804 - 507 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 dollars. No costs related to the investigation, restitution,\\n2 or refunds may be recoverable through rates.\\n3 (d) Funds collected pursuant to this Section shall be\\n4 repaid by the public utility in the following manner:\\n5 (1) 25% shall be contributed to expand the Percentage\\n6 of Income Payment Program;\\n7 (2) 25%, or no less than $20 million annually, shall\\n8 be contributed to the Energy Community Reinvestment Fund\\n9 to support the Jobs and Environmental Justice Grant\\n10 Program, as described in the Expanding Clean Energy\\n11 Entrepreneurship Program of the Clean Jobs, Workforce and\\n12 Contractor Equity Act; and\\n13 (3) the remaining percentage of funds collected shall\\n14 be provided as a per-kilowatt-hour credit to the public\\n15 utility\\'s ratepayers.\\n16 (220 ILCS 5/8-103B)\\n17 Sec. 8-103B. Energy efficiency and demand-response\\n18 measures.\\n19 (a) It is the policy of the State that electric utilities\\n20 are required to use cost-effective energy efficiency and\\n21 demand-response measures to reduce delivery load. Requiring\\n22 investment in cost-effective energy efficiency and\\n23 demand-response measures will reduce direct and indirect costs\\n24 to consumers by decreasing environmental impacts and by\\n25 avoiding or delaying the need for new generation,HB0804 - 508 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 transmission, and distribution infrastructure. It serves the\\n2 public interest to allow electric utilities to recover costs\\n3 for reasonably and prudently incurred expenditures for energy\\n4 efficiency and demand-response measures. As used in this\\n5 Section, \"cost-effective\" means that the measures satisfy the\\n6 total resource cost test. The low-income measures described in\\n7 subsection (c) of this Section shall not be required to meet\\n8 the total resource cost test. For purposes of this Section,\\n9 the terms \"energy-efficiency\", \"demand-response\", \"electric\\n10 utility\", and \"total resource cost test\" have the meanings set\\n11 forth in the Illinois Power Agency Act. \"Black, indigenous,\\n12 and people of color\" and \"BIPOC\" means people who are members\\n13 of the groups described in subparagraphs (a) through (e) of\\n14 paragraph (A) of subsection (1) of Section 2 of the Business\\n15 Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with\\n16 Disabilities Act. \"Expanding Clean Energy Entrepreneurship and\\n17 Contractor Incubator Network Program,\" \"Clean Energy Black,\\n18 Indigenous, and People of Color Primes Contractor\\n19 Accelerator,\" \"Returning Resident Clean Energy Training\\n20 Program,\" and \"Clean Energy Workforce Training Hubs Program\"\\n21 are as set forth in the Clean Jobs, Workforce and Contractor\\n22 Equity Act.\\n23 (a-5) This Section applies to electric utilities serving\\n24 more than 500,000 retail customers in the State for those\\n25 multi-year plans commencing after December 31, 2017.\\n26 (b) For purposes of this Section, electric utilitiesHB0804 - 509 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subject to this Section that serve more than 3,000,000 retail\\n2 customers in the State shall be deemed to have achieved a\\n3 cumulative persisting annual savings of 6.6% from energy\\n4 efficiency measures and programs implemented during the period\\n5 beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2017, which\\n6 percent is based on the deemed average weather normalized\\n7 sales of electric power and energy during calendar years 2014,\\n8 2015, and 2016 of 88,000,000 MWhs. For the purposes of this\\n9 subsection (b) and subsection (b-5), the 88,000,000 MWhs of\\n10 deemed electric power and energy sales shall be reduced by the\\n11 number of MWhs equal to the sum of the annual consumption of\\n12 customers that are exempt from subsections (a) through (j) of\\n13 this Section under subsection (l) of this Section, as averaged\\n14 across the calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016.

and\\n8 (13) 21.5% cumulative persisting annual savings for\\n9 the year ending December 31, 2030.\\n10 No later than December 31, 2021, the Illinois Commerce\\n11 Commission shall establish additional cumulative persisting\\n12 annual savings goals for the years 2031 through 2035. No later\\n13 than December 31, 2024, the Illinois Commerce Commission shall\\n14 establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings\\n15 goals for the years 2036 through 2040. The Commission shall\\n16 also establish additional cumulative persisting annual savings\\n17 goals every 5 years thereafter to ensure utilities always have\\n18 goals that extend at least 11 years into the future. The\\n19 cumulative persisting annual savings goals beyond the year\\n20 2030 shall increase by 0.9 percentage points per year, absent\\n21 a Commission decision to initiate a proceeding to consider\\n22 establishing goals that increase by more or less than that\\n23 amount. Such a proceeding must be conducted in accordance with\\n24 the procedures described in subsection (f) of this Section. If\\n25 such a proceeding is initiated, the cumulative persisting\\n26 annual savings goals established by the Commission throughHB0804 - 514 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 that proceeding shall reflect the Commission\\'s best estimate\\n2 of the maximum amount of additional savings that are forecast\\n3 to be cost-effectively achievable unless such best estimates\\n4 would result in goals that represent less than 0.5 percentage\\n5 point annual increases in total cumulative persisting annual\\n6 savings. The Commission may only establish goals that\\n7 represent less than 0.5 percentage point annual increases in\\n8 cumulative persisting annual savings if it can demonstrate,\\n9 based on clear and convincing evidence and through independent\\n10 analysis, that 0.5 percentage point increases are not\\n11 cost-effectively achievable.

The electric utility may count\\n9 the reduction in energy consumption at the premises toward\\n10 achievement of its annual savings goals. The reduction in\\n11 energy consumption at the premises shall be calculated as the\\n12 difference between: (A) the reduction in Btu consumption of\\n13 fossil fuels as a result of electrification, converted to\\n14 kilowatt-hour equivalents by dividing by 3,412 Btu\\'s per\\n15 kilowatt hour; and (B) the increase in kilowatt hours of\\n16 electricity consumption resulting from the displacement of\\n17 fossil fuel consumption as a result of electrification. An\\n18 electric utility may recover the costs of offering and\\n19 promoting electrification measures under this subsection\\n20 (b-27).\\n21 In no event shall electrification savings counted toward\\n22 each year\\'s applicable annual total savings requirement, as\\n23 defined in paragraph (7.5) of subsection (g) of this Section,\\n24 be greater than:\\n25 (1) 5% per year for each year from 2022 through 2025;\\n26 (2) 10% per year for each year from 2026 through 2029;HB0804 - 524 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 and\\n2 (3) 15% per year for 2030 and all subsequent years.\\n3 In addition, a minimum of 25% of all electrification savings\\n4 counted toward a utility\\'s applicable annual total savings\\n5 requirement must be from electrification of end uses in\\n6 low-income housing.

The sole fact that a\\n3 cost differs from that incurred in a prior calendar\\n4 year or that an investment is different from that made\\n5 in a prior calendar year shall not imply the\\n6 imprudence or unreasonableness of that cost or\\n7 investment.\\n8 (B) Reflect the utility\\'s actual year-end capital\\n9 structure for the applicable calendar year, excluding\\n10 goodwill, subject to a determination of prudence and\\n11 reasonableness consistent with Commission practice and\\n12 law. To enable the financing of the incremental\\n13 capital expenditures, including regulatory assets, for\\n14 electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000\\n15 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail\\n16 customers in the State, a participating electric\\n17 utility\\'s actual year-end capital structure that\\n18 includes a common equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of\\n19 up to and including 50% of the total capital structure\\n20 shall be deemed reasonable and used to set rates.\\n21 (C) Include a cost of equity, which shall be\\n22 calculated as the sum of the following:\\n23 (i) the average for the applicable calendar\\n24 year of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S.\\n25 Treasury bonds published by the Board of Governors\\n26 of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15HB0804 - 535 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Statistical Release or successor publication; and\\n2 (ii) 580 basis points.\\n3 At such time as the Board of Governors of the\\n4 Federal Reserve System ceases to include the monthly\\n5 average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds in its\\n6 weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor\\n7 publication, the monthly average yields of the U.S.\\n8 Treasury bonds then having the longest duration\\n9 published by the Board of Governors in its weekly H.15\\n10 Statistical Release or successor publication shall\\n11 instead be used for purposes of this paragraph (2).\\n12 (D) Permit and set forth protocols, subject to a\\n13 determination of prudence and reasonableness\\n14 consistent with Commission practice and law, for the\\n15 following:\\n16 (i) recovery of incentive compensation expense\\n17 that is based on the achievement of operational\\n18 metrics, including metrics related to budget\\n19 controls, outage duration and frequency, safety,\\n20 customer service, efficiency and productivity, and\\n21 environmental compliance; however, this protocol\\n22 shall not apply if such expense related to costs\\n23 incurred under this Section is recovered under\\n24 Article IX or Section 16-108.5 of this Act;\\n25 incentive compensation expense that is based on\\n26 net income or an affiliate\\'s earnings per shareHB0804 - 536 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 shall not be recoverable under the energy\\n2 efficiency formula rate;\\n3 (ii) recovery of pension and other\\n4 post-employment benefits expense, provided that\\n5 such costs are supported by an actuarial study;\\n6 however, this protocol shall not apply if such\\n7 expense related to costs incurred under this\\n8 Section is recovered under Article IX or Section\\n9 16-108.5 of this Act;\\n10 (iii) recovery of existing regulatory assets\\n11 over the periods previously authorized by the\\n12 Commission;\\n13 (iv) as described in subsection (e),\\n14 amortization of costs incurred under this Section;\\n15 and\\n16 (v) projected, weather normalized billing\\n17 determinants for the applicable rate year.\\n18 (E) Provide for an annual reconciliation, as\\n19 described in paragraph (3) of this subsection (d),\\n20 less any deferred taxes related to the reconciliation,\\n21 with interest at an annual rate of return equal to the\\n22 utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital, including\\n23 a revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or\\n24 refund all additional income taxes that may be payable\\n25 or receivable as a result of that return, of the energy\\n26 efficiency revenue requirement reflected in rates forHB0804 - 537 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year\\n2 in which the utility files its energy efficiency\\n3 formula rate tariff under this paragraph (2), with\\n4 what the revenue requirement would have been had the\\n5 actual cost information for the applicable calendar\\n6 year been available at the filing date.\\n7 The utility shall file, together with its tariff, the\\n8 projected costs to be incurred by the utility during the\\n9 rate year under the utility\\'s multi-year plan approved\\n10 under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section, including,\\n11 but not limited to, the projected capital investment costs\\n12 and projected regulatory asset balances with\\n13 correspondingly updated depreciation and amortization\\n14 reserves and expense, that shall populate the energy\\n15 efficiency formula rate and set the initial rates under\\n16 the formula.\\n17 The Commission shall review the proposed tariff in\\n18 conjunction with its review of a proposed multi-year plan,\\n19 as specified in paragraph (5) of subsection (g) of this\\n20 Section. The review shall be based on the same evidentiary\\n21 standards, including, but not limited to, those concerning\\n22 the prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred by\\n23 the utility, the Commission applies in a hearing to review\\n24 a filing for a general increase in rates under Article IX\\n25 of this Act. The initial rates shall take effect beginning\\n26 with the January monthly billing period following theHB0804 - 538 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Commission\\'s approval.\\n2 The tariff\\'s rate design and cost allocation across\\n3 customer classes shall be consistent with the utility\\'s\\n4 automatic adjustment clause tariff in effect on June 1,\\n5 2017 (the effective date of Public Act 99-906); however,\\n6 the Commission may revise the tariff\\'s rate design and\\n7 cost allocation in subsequent proceedings under paragraph\\n8 (3) of this subsection (d).\\n9 If the energy efficiency formula rate is terminated,\\n10 the then current rates shall remain in effect until such\\n11 time as the energy efficiency costs are incorporated into\\n12 new rates that are set under this subsection (d) or\\n13 Article IX of this Act, subject to retroactive rate\\n14 adjustment, with interest, to reconcile rates charged with\\n15 actual costs.\\n16 (3) The provisions of this paragraph (3) shall only\\n17 apply to an electric utility that has elected to file an\\n18 energy efficiency formula rate under paragraph (2) of this\\n19 subsection (d). Subsequent to the Commission\\'s issuance of\\n20 an order approving the utility\\'s energy efficiency formula\\n21 rate structure and protocols, and initial rates under\\n22 paragraph (2) of this subsection (d), the utility shall\\n23 file, on or before June 1 of each year, with the Chief\\n24 Clerk of the Commission its updated cost inputs to the\\n25 energy efficiency formula rate for the applicable rate\\n26 year and the corresponding new charges, as well as theHB0804 - 539 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 information described in paragraph (9) of subsection (g)\\n2 of this Section. Each such filing shall conform to the\\n3 following requirements and include the following\\n4 information:\\n5 (A) The inputs to the energy efficiency formula\\n6 rate for the applicable rate year shall be based on the\\n7 projected costs to be incurred by the utility during\\n8 the rate year under the utility\\'s multi-year plan\\n9 approved under subsections (f) and (g) of this\\n10 Section, including, but not limited to, projected\\n11 capital investment costs and projected regulatory\\n12 asset balances with correspondingly updated\\n13 depreciation and amortization reserves and expense.\\n14 The filing shall also include a reconciliation of the\\n15 energy efficiency revenue requirement that was in\\n16 effect for the prior rate year (as set by the cost\\n17 inputs for the prior rate year) with the actual\\n18 revenue requirement for the prior rate year\\n19 (determined using a year-end rate base) that uses\\n20 amounts reflected in the applicable FERC Form 1 that\\n21 reports the actual costs for the prior rate year. Any\\n22 over-collection or under-collection indicated by such\\n23 reconciliation shall be reflected as a credit against,\\n24 or recovered as an additional charge to, respectively,\\n25 with interest calculated at a rate equal to the\\n26 utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital approved byHB0804 - 540 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the Commission for the prior rate year, the charges\\n2 for the applicable rate year. Such over-collection or\\n3 under-collection shall be adjusted to remove any\\n4 deferred taxes related to the reconciliation, for\\n5 purposes of calculating interest at an annual rate of\\n6 return equal to the utility\\'s weighted average cost of\\n7 capital approved by the Commission for the prior rate\\n8 year, including a revenue conversion factor calculated\\n9 to recover or refund all additional income taxes that\\n10 may be payable or receivable as a result of that\\n11 return. Each reconciliation shall be certified by the\\n12 participating utility in the same manner that FERC\\n13 Form 1 is certified. The filing shall also include the\\n14 charge or credit, if any, resulting from the\\n15 calculation required by subparagraph (E) of paragraph\\n16 (2) of this subsection (d).\\n17 Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the\\n18 contrary, the intent of the reconciliation is to\\n19 ultimately reconcile both the revenue requirement\\n20 reflected in rates for each calendar year, beginning\\n21 with the calendar year in which the utility files its\\n22 energy efficiency formula rate tariff under paragraph\\n23 (2) of this subsection (d), with what the revenue\\n24 requirement determined using a year-end rate base for\\n25 the applicable calendar year would have been had the\\n26 actual cost information for the applicable calendarHB0804 - 541 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 year been available at the filing date.\\n2 For purposes of this Section, \"FERC Form 1\" means\\n3 the Annual Report of Major Electric Utilities,\\n4 Licensees and Others that electric utilities are\\n5 required to file with the Federal Energy Regulatory\\n6 Commission under the Federal Power Act, Sections 3,\\n7 4(a), 304 and 209, modified as necessary to be\\n8 consistent with 83 Ill. Admin. Code Part 415 as of May\\n9 1, 2011. Nothing in this Section is intended to allow\\n10 costs that are not otherwise recoverable to be\\n11 recoverable by virtue of inclusion in FERC Form 1.\\n12 (B) The new charges shall take effect beginning on\\n13 the first billing day of the following January billing\\n14 period and remain in effect through the last billing\\n15 day of the next December billing period regardless of\\n16 whether the Commission enters upon a hearing under\\n17 this paragraph (3).\\n18 (C) The filing shall include relevant and\\n19 necessary data and documentation for the applicable\\n20 rate year. Normalization adjustments shall not be\\n21 required.\\n22 Within 45 days after the utility files its annual\\n23 update of cost inputs to the energy efficiency formula\\n24 rate, the Commission shall with reasonable notice,\\n25 initiate a proceeding concerning whether the projected\\n26 costs to be incurred by the utility and recovered duringHB0804 - 542 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the applicable rate year, and that are reflected in the\\n2 inputs to the energy efficiency formula rate, are\\n3 consistent with the utility\\'s approved multi-year plan\\n4 under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section and whether\\n5 the costs incurred by the utility during the prior rate\\n6 year were prudent and reasonable. The Commission shall\\n7 also have the authority to investigate the information and\\n8 data described in paragraph (9) of subsection (g) of this\\n9 Section, including the proposed adjustment to the\\n10 utility\\'s return on equity component of its weighted\\n11 average cost of capital. During the course of the\\n12 proceeding, each objection shall be stated with\\n13 particularity and evidence provided in support thereof,\\n14 after which the utility shall have the opportunity to\\n15 rebut the evidence. Discovery shall be allowed consistent\\n16 with the Commission\\'s Rules of Practice, which Rules of\\n17 Practice shall be enforced by the Commission or the\\n18 assigned administrative law judge. The Commission shall\\n19 apply the same evidentiary standards, including, but not\\n20 limited to, those concerning the prudence and\\n21 reasonableness of the costs incurred by the utility,\\n22 during the proceeding as it would apply in a proceeding to\\n23 review a filing for a general increase in rates under\\n24 Article IX of this Act. The Commission shall not, however,\\n25 have the authority in a proceeding under this paragraph\\n26 (3) to consider or order any changes to the structure orHB0804 - 543 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 protocols of the energy efficiency formula rate approved\\n2 under paragraph (2) of this subsection (d). In a\\n3 proceeding under this paragraph (3), the Commission shall\\n4 enter its order no later than the earlier of 195 days after\\n5 the utility\\'s filing of its annual update of cost inputs\\n6 to the energy efficiency formula rate or December 15. The\\n7 utility\\'s proposed return on equity calculation, as\\n8 described in paragraphs (7) through (9) of subsection (g)\\n9 of this Section, shall be deemed the final, approved\\n10 calculation on December 15 of the year in which it is filed\\n11 unless the Commission enters an order on or before\\n12 December 15, after notice and hearing, that modifies such\\n13 calculation consistent with this Section. The Commission\\'s\\n14 determinations of the prudence and reasonableness of the\\n15 costs incurred, and determination of such return on equity\\n16 calculation, for the applicable calendar year shall be\\n17 final upon entry of the Commission\\'s order and shall not\\n18 be subject to reopening, reexamination, or collateral\\n19 attack in any other Commission proceeding, case, docket,\\n20 order, rule, or regulation; however, nothing in this\\n21 paragraph (3) shall prohibit a party from petitioning the\\n22 Commission to rehear or appeal to the courts the order\\n23 under the provisions of this Act.\\n24 (e) Beginning on June 1, 2017 (the effective date of\\n25 Public Act 99-906), a utility subject to the requirements of\\n26 this Section may elect to defer, as a regulatory asset, up toHB0804 - 544 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the full amount of its expenditures incurred under this\\n2 Section for each annual period, including, but not limited to,\\n3 any expenditures incurred above the funding level set by\\n4 subsection (f) of this Section for a given year. The total\\n5 expenditures deferred as a regulatory asset in a given year\\n6 shall be amortized and recovered over a period that is equal to\\n7 the weighted average of the energy efficiency measure lives\\n8 implemented for that year that are reflected in the regulatory\\n9 asset. The unamortized balance shall be recognized as of\\n10 December 31 for a given year. The utility shall also earn a\\n11 return on the total of the unamortized balances of all of the\\n12 energy efficiency regulatory assets, less any deferred taxes\\n13 related to those unamortized balances, at an annual rate equal\\n14 to the utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital that\\n15 includes, based on a year-end capital structure, the utility\\'s\\n16 actual cost of debt for the applicable calendar year and a cost\\n17 of equity, which shall be calculated as the sum of the (i) the\\n18 average for the applicable calendar year of the monthly\\n19 average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by the\\n20 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly\\n21 H.15 Statistical Release or successor publication; and (ii)\\n22 580 basis points, including a revenue conversion factor\\n23 calculated to recover or refund all additional income taxes\\n24 that may be payable or receivable as a result of that return.\\n25 Capital investment costs shall be depreciated and recovered\\n26 over their useful lives consistent with generally acceptedHB0804 - 545 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 accounting principles. The weighted average cost of capital\\n2 shall be applied to the capital investment cost balance, less\\n3 any accumulated depreciation and accumulated deferred income\\n4 taxes, as of December 31 for a given year.\\n5 When an electric utility creates a regulatory asset under\\n6 the provisions of this Section, the costs are recovered over a\\n7 period during which customers also receive a benefit which is\\n8 in the public interest. Accordingly, it is the intent of the\\n9 General Assembly that an electric utility that elects to\\n10 create a regulatory asset under the provisions of this Section\\n11 shall recover all of the associated costs as set forth in this\\n12 Section. After the Commission has approved the prudence and\\n13 reasonableness of the costs that comprise the regulatory\\n14 asset, the electric utility shall be permitted to recover all\\n15 such costs, and the value and recoverability through rates of\\n16 the associated regulatory asset shall not be limited, altered,\\n17 impaired, or reduced.\\n18 (f) Beginning in 2017, each electric utility shall file an\\n19 energy efficiency plan with the Commission to meet the energy\\n20 efficiency standards for the next applicable multi-year period\\n21 beginning January 1 of the year following the filing,\\n22 according to the schedule set forth in paragraphs (1) through\\n23 (3) of this subsection (f). If a utility does not file such a\\n24 plan on or before the applicable filing deadline for the plan,\\n25 it shall face a penalty of $100,000 per day until the plan is\\n26 filed.HB0804 - 546 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (1) No later than 30 days after June 1, 2017 (the\\n2 effective date of Public Act 99-906), each electric\\n3 utility shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan\\n4 commencing on January 1, 2018 that is designed to achieve\\n5 the cumulative persisting annual savings goals specified\\n6 in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection (b-5) of this\\n7 Section or in paragraphs (1) through (4) of subsection\\n8 (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, through\\n9 implementation of energy efficiency measures; however, the\\n10 goals may be reduced if the utility\\'s expenditures are\\n11 limited pursuant to subsection (m) of this Section or, for\\n12 a utility that serves less than 3,000,000 retail\\n13 customers, if each of the following conditions are met:\\n14 (A) the plan\\'s analysis and forecasts of the utility\\'s\\n15 ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate that\\n16 achievement of such goals is not cost effective; and (B)\\n17 the amount of energy savings achieved by the utility as\\n18 determined by the independent evaluator for the most\\n19 recent year for which savings have been evaluated\\n20 preceding the plan filing was less than the average annual\\n21 amount of savings required to achieve the goals for the\\n22 applicable 4-year plan period. Except as provided in\\n23 subsection (m) of this Section, annual increases in\\n24 cumulative persisting annual savings goals during the\\n25 applicable 4-year plan period shall not be reduced to\\n26 amounts that are less than the maximum amount ofHB0804 - 547 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 cumulative persisting annual savings that is forecast to\\n2 be cost-effectively achievable during the 4-year plan\\n3 period. The Commission shall review any proposed goal\\n4 reduction as part of its review and approval of the\\n5 utility\\'s proposed plan.\\n6 (2) No later than March 1, 2021, each electric utility\\n7 shall file a 4-year energy efficiency plan commencing on\\n8 January 1, 2022 that is designed to achieve the cumulative\\n9 persisting annual savings goals specified in paragraphs\\n10 (5) through (8) of subsection (b-5) of this Section or in\\n11 paragraphs (5) through (8) of subsection (b-15) of this\\n12 Section, as applicable, through implementation of energy\\n13 efficiency measures; however, the goals may be reduced if\\n14 either (1) clear and convincing evidence demonstrates,\\n15 through independent analysis, that the expenditure limits\\n16 in subsection (m) of this Section preclude full\\n17 achievement of the goals or (2) the utility\\'s expenditures\\n18 are limited pursuant to subsection (m) of this Section or,\\n19 each of the following conditions are met: (A) the plan\\'s\\n20 analysis and forecasts of the utility\\'s ability to acquire\\n21 energy savings demonstrate by clear and convincing\\n22 evidence and through independent analysis that achievement\\n23 of such goals is not cost effective; and (B) the amount of\\n24 energy savings achieved by the utility as determined by\\n25 the independent evaluator for the most recent year for\\n26 which savings have been evaluated preceding the planHB0804 - 548 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 filing was less than the average annual amount of savings\\n2 required to achieve the goals for the applicable 4-year\\n3 plan period. If there is any significant uncertainty\\n4 regarding whether achieving the savings goals specified in\\n5 paragraph (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section is possible both\\n6 cost-effectively and within the expenditure limits in\\n7 subsection (m), such savings goals shall not be reduced.\\n8 Except as provided in subsection (m) of this Section,\\n9 annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings\\n10 goals during the applicable 4-year plan period shall not\\n11 be reduced to amounts that are less than the maximum\\n12 amount of cumulative persisting annual savings that is\\n13 forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during the\\n14 4-year plan period. The Commission shall review any\\n15 proposed goal reduction as part of its review and approval\\n16 of the utility\\'s proposed plan, taking into account the\\n17 results of the potential study required by subsection\\n18 (f-5) of this Section.\\n19 (3) No later than March 1, 2025, each electric utility\\n20 shall file a 4-year 5-year energy efficiency plan\\n21 commencing on January 1, 2026 that is designed to achieve\\n22 the cumulative persisting annual savings goals specified\\n23 in paragraphs (9) through (12) (13) of subsection (b-5) of\\n24 this Section or in paragraphs (9) through (12) (13) of\\n25 subsection (b-15) of this Section, as applicable, through\\n26 implementation of energy efficiency measures; however, theHB0804 - 549 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 goals may be reduced if either (1) clear and convincing\\n2 evidence demonstrates, through independent analysis, that\\n3 the expenditure limits in subsection (m) of this Section\\n4 preclude full achievement of the goals or (2) the\\n5 utility\\'s expenditures are limited pursuant to subsection\\n6 (m) of this Section or, each of the following conditions\\n7 are met: (A) the plan\\'s analysis and forecasts of the\\n8 utility\\'s ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate by\\n9 clear and convincing evidence and through independent\\n10 analysis that achievement of such goals is not cost\\n11 effective; and (B) the amount of energy savings achieved\\n12 by the utility as determined by the independent evaluator\\n13 for the most recent year for which savings have been\\n14 evaluated preceding the plan filing was less than the\\n15 average annual amount of savings required to achieve the\\n16 goals for the applicable 4-year 5-year plan period. If\\n17 there is any significant uncertainty regarding whether\\n18 achieving the savings goals specified in paragraphs (b-5)\\n19 or (b-15) of this Section is possible both\\n20 cost-effectively and within the expenditure limits in\\n21 subsection (m), such savings goals shall not be reduced.\\n22 Except as provided in subsection (m) of this Section,\\n23 annual increases in cumulative persisting annual savings\\n24 goals during the applicable 4-year 5-year plan period\\n25 shall not be reduced to amounts that are less than the\\n26 maximum amount of cumulative persisting annual savingsHB0804 - 550 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 that is forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during\\n2 the 4-year 5-year plan period. The Commission shall review\\n3 any proposed goal reduction as part of its review and\\n4 approval of the utility\\'s proposed plan, taking into\\n5 account the results of the potential study required by\\n6 subsection (f-5) of this Section.\\n7 (4) No later than March 1, 2029, and every 4 years\\n8 thereafter, each electric utility shall file a 4-year\\n9 energy efficiency plan commencing on January 1, 2030, and\\n10 every 4 years thereafter, respectively, that is designed\\n11 to achieve the cumulative persisting annual savings goals\\n12 established by the Illinois Commerce Commission pursuant\\n13 to direction of subsections (b-5) and (b-15) of this\\n14 Section, as applicable, through implementation of energy\\n15 efficiency measures; however, the goals may be reduced if\\n16 either (1) clear and convincing evidence and independent\\n17 analysis demonstrates that the expenditure limits in\\n18 subsection (m) of this Section preclude full achievement\\n19 of the goals or (2) each of the following conditions are\\n20 met: (A) the plan\\'s analysis and forecasts of the\\n21 utility\\'s ability to acquire energy savings demonstrate by\\n22 clear and convincing evidence and through independent\\n23 analysis that achievement of such goals is not\\n24 cost-effective; and (B) the amount of energy savings\\n25 achieved by the utility as determined by the independent\\n26 evaluator for the most recent year for which savings haveHB0804 - 551 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 been evaluated preceding the plan filing was less than the\\n2 average annual amount of savings required to achieve the\\n3 goals for the applicable 4-year plan period. If there is\\n4 any significant uncertainty regarding whether achieving\\n5 the savings goals specified in paragraphs (b-5) or (b-15)\\n6 of this Section is possible both cost-effectively and\\n7 within the expenditure limits in subsection (m), such\\n8 savings goals shall not be reduced. Except as provided in\\n9 subsection (m) of this Section, annual increases in\\n10 cumulative persisting annual savings goals during the\\n11 applicable 4-year plan period shall not be reduced to\\n12 amounts that are less than the maximum amount of\\n13 cumulative persisting annual savings that is forecast to\\n14 be cost-effectively achievable during the 4-year plan\\n15 period. The Commission shall review any proposed goal\\n16 reduction as part of its review and approval of the\\n17 utility\\'s proposed plan.\\n18 Each utility\\'s plan shall set forth the utility\\'s\\n19 proposals to meet the energy efficiency standards identified\\n20 in subsection (b-5) or (b-15), as applicable and as such\\n21 standards may have been modified under this subsection (f),\\n22 taking into account the unique circumstances of the utility\\'s\\n23 service territory and results of an energy efficiency\\n24 potential study as described in subsection (f-5) of this\\n25 Section. For those plans commencing on January 1, 2018, the\\n26 Commission shall seek public comment on the utility\\'s plan andHB0804 - 552 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 shall issue an order approving or disapproving each plan no\\n2 later than 105 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date of\\n3 Public Act 99-906). For those plans commencing after December\\n4 31, 2021, the Commission shall seek public comment on the\\n5 utility\\'s plan and shall issue an order approving or\\n6 disapproving each plan within 6 months after its submission.\\n7 If the Commission disapproves a plan, the Commission shall,\\n8 within 30 days, describe in detail the reasons for the\\n9 disapproval and describe a path by which the utility may file a\\n10 revised draft of the plan to address the Commission\\'s concerns\\n11 satisfactorily. If the utility does not refile with the\\n12 Commission within 60 days, the utility shall be subject to\\n13 penalties at a rate of $100,000 per day until the plan is\\n14 filed. This process shall continue, and penalties shall\\n15 accrue, until the utility has successfully filed a portfolio\\n16 of energy efficiency and demand-response measures. Penalties\\n17 shall be deposited into the Energy Efficiency Trust Fund.\\n18 (f-5) Energy efficiency potential study. An energy\\n19 efficiency potential study shall be commissioned and overseen\\n20 by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The potential study shall\\n21 be a dual fuel study, addressing both gas and electric\\n22 efficiency potential, such that the requirements both in this\\n23 subsection (f-5) and in subsection (j-5) of Section 8-104.1\\n24 are met in an integrated and cost-efficient manner. The\\n25 potential study shall be reviewed as part of the approval of a\\n26 utility\\'s plan filed pursuant to subsection (f) of thisHB0804 - 553 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Section. The potential study shall be designed and conducted\\n2 with input from a Potential Study Stakeholder Committee\\n3 established by the Commission.

Individual measures need not\\n2 be cost effective.\\n3 (3.5) Demonstrate that the utility\\'s plan integrates\\n4 the delivery of energy efficiency programs with natural\\n5 gas efficiency programs, programs promoting distributed\\n6 solar, programs promoting demand response and other\\n7 efforts to address bill payment issues, including, but not\\n8 limited to, LIHEAP and the Percentage of Income Payment\\n9 Plan, to the extent such integration is practical and has\\n10 the potential to enhance customer engagement, minimize\\n11 market confusion, or reduce administrative costs.\\n12 (4) Present a third-party energy efficiency\\n13 implementation program subject to the following\\n14 requirements:\\n15 (A) beginning with the year commencing January 1,\\n16 2019, electric utilities that serve more than\\n17 3,000,000 retail customers in the State shall fund\\n18 third-party energy efficiency programs in an amount\\n19 that is no less than $25,000,000 per year, and\\n20 electric utilities that serve less than 3,000,000\\n21 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail\\n22 customers in the State shall fund third-party energy\\n23 efficiency programs in an amount that is no less than\\n24 $8,350,000 per year;\\n25 (B) during 2018, the utility shall conduct a\\n26 solicitation process for purposes of requestingHB0804 - 556 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 proposals from third-party vendors for those\\n2 third-party energy efficiency programs to be offered\\n3 during one or more of the years commencing January 1,\\n4 2019, January 1, 2020, and January 1, 2021; for those\\n5 multi-year plans commencing on January 1, 2022 and\\n6 January 1, 2026, the utility shall conduct a\\n7 solicitation process during 2021 and 2025,\\n8 respectively, for purposes of requesting proposals\\n9 from third-party vendors for those third-party energy\\n10 efficiency programs to be offered during one or more\\n11 years of the respective multi-year plan period; for\\n12 each solicitation process, the utility shall identify\\n13 the sector, technology, or geographical area for which\\n14 it is seeking requests for proposals; the solicitation\\n15 process must be either for programs that fill gaps in\\n16 the utility\\'s program portfolio or for programs that\\n17 target business sectors, building types, geographies,\\n18 or other specific parts of its customer base with\\n19 initiatives that would be more effective at reaching\\n20 these customer segments than the utilities\\' programs\\n21 filed in its energy efficiency plans;\\n22 (C) the utility shall propose the bidder\\n23 qualifications, performance measurement process, and\\n24 contract structure, which must include a performance\\n25 payment mechanism and general terms and conditions;\\n26 the proposed qualifications, process, and structureHB0804 - 557 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 shall be subject to Commission approval; and\\n2 (D) the utility shall retain an independent third\\n3 party to score the proposals received through the\\n4 solicitation process described in this paragraph (4),\\n5 rank them according to their cost per lifetime\\n6 kilowatt-hours saved, and assemble the portfolio of\\n7 third-party programs.\\n8 The electric utility shall recover all costs\\n9 associated with Commission-approved, third-party\\n10 administered programs regardless of the success of those\\n11 programs.\\n12 (4.5) Implement cost-effective demand-response\\n13 measures to reduce peak demand by 0.1% over the prior year\\n14 for eligible retail customers, as defined in Section\\n15 16-111.5 of this Act, and for customers that elect hourly\\n16 service from the utility pursuant to Section 16-107 of\\n17 this Act, provided those customers have not been declared\\n18 competitive. This requirement continues until December 31,\\n19 2026.\\n20 (5) Include a proposed or revised cost-recovery tariff\\n21 mechanism, as provided for under subsection (d) of this\\n22 Section, to fund the proposed energy efficiency and\\n23 demand-response measures and to ensure the recovery of the\\n24 prudently and reasonably incurred costs of\\n25 Commission-approved programs.\\n26 (6) Provide for an annual independent evaluation ofHB0804 - 558 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the performance of the cost-effectiveness of the utility\\'s\\n2 portfolio of measures, as well as a full review of the\\n3 multi-year plan results of the broader net program impacts\\n4 and, to the extent practical, for adjustment of the\\n5 measures on a going-forward basis as a result of the\\n6 evaluations. The resources dedicated to evaluation shall\\n7 not exceed 3% of portfolio resources in any given year.\\n8 (7) For electric utilities that serve more than\\n9 3,000,000 retail customers in the State:\\n10 (A) Through December 31, 2025, provide for an\\n11 adjustment to the return on equity component of the\\n12 utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital calculated\\n13 under subsection (d) of this Section:\\n14 (i) If the independent evaluator determines\\n15 that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting\\n16 annual savings that is less than the applicable\\n17 annual incremental goal, then the return on equity\\n18 component shall be reduced by a maximum of 200\\n19 basis points in the event that the utility\\n20 achieved no more than 75% of such goal. If the\\n21 utility achieved more than 75% of the applicable\\n22 annual incremental goal but less than 100% of such\\n23 goal, then the return on equity component shall be\\n24 reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by\\n25 which the utility failed to achieve the goal.\\n26 (ii) If the independent evaluator determinesHB0804 - 559 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting\\n2 annual savings that is more than the applicable\\n3 annual incremental goal, then the return on equity\\n4 component shall be increased by a maximum of 200\\n5 basis points in the event that the utility\\n6 achieved at least 125% of such goal. If the\\n7 utility achieved more than 100% of the applicable\\n8 annual incremental goal but less than 125% of such\\n9 goal, then the return on equity component shall be\\n10 increased by 8 basis points for each percent by\\n11 which the utility achieved above the goal. If the\\n12 applicable annual incremental goal was reduced\\n13 under paragraphs (1) or (2) of subsection (f) of\\n14 this Section, then the following adjustments shall\\n15 be made to the calculations described in this item\\n16 (ii):\\n17 (aa) the calculation for determining\\n18 achievement that is at least 125% of the\\n19 applicable annual incremental goal shall use\\n20 the unreduced applicable annual incremental\\n21 goal to set the value; and\\n22 (bb) the calculation for determining\\n23 achievement that is less than 125% but more\\n24 than 100% of the applicable annual incremental\\n25 goal shall use the reduced applicable annual\\n26 incremental goal to set the value for 100%HB0804 - 560 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 achievement of the goal and shall use the\\n2 unreduced goal to set the value for 125%\\n3 achievement. The 8 basis point value shall\\n4 also be modified, as necessary, so that the\\n5 200 basis points are evenly apportioned among\\n6 each percentage point value between 100% and\\n7 125% achievement.\\n8 (B) For the period January 1, 2026 through\\n9 December 31, 2029 and in all subsequent 4-year periods\\n10 2030, provide for an adjustment to the return on\\n11 equity component of the utility\\'s weighted average\\n12 cost of capital calculated under subsection (d) of\\n13 this Section:\\n14 (i) If the independent evaluator determines\\n15 that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting\\n16 annual savings that is less than the applicable\\n17 annual incremental goal, then the return on equity\\n18 component shall be reduced by a maximum of 200\\n19 basis points in the event that the utility\\n20 achieved no more than 66% of such goal. If the\\n21 utility achieved more than 66% of the applicable\\n22 annual incremental goal but less than 100% of such\\n23 goal, then the return on equity component shall be\\n24 reduced by 6 basis points for each percent by\\n25 which the utility failed to achieve the goal.\\n26 (ii) If the independent evaluator determinesHB0804 - 561 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting\\n2 annual savings that is more than the applicable\\n3 annual incremental goal, then the return on equity\\n4 component shall be increased by a maximum of 200\\n5 basis points in the event that the utility\\n6 achieved at least 134% of such goal. If the\\n7 utility achieved more than 100% of the applicable\\n8 annual incremental goal but less than 134% of such\\n9 goal, then the return on equity component shall be\\n10 increased by 6 basis points for each percent by\\n11 which the utility achieved above the goal. If the\\n12 applicable annual incremental goal was reduced\\n13 under paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this\\n14 Section, then the following adjustments shall be\\n15 made to the calculations described in this item\\n16 (ii):\\n17 (aa) the calculation for determining\\n18 achievement that is at least 134% of the\\n19 applicable annual incremental goal shall use\\n20 the unreduced applicable annual incremental\\n21 goal to set the value; and\\n22 (bb) the calculation for determining\\n23 achievement that is less than 134% but more\\n24 than 100% of the applicable annual incremental\\n25 goal shall use the reduced applicable annual\\n26 incremental goal to set the value for 100%HB0804 - 562 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 achievement of the goal and shall use the\\n2 unreduced goal to set the value for 134%\\n3 achievement. The 6 basis point value shall\\n4 also be modified, as necessary, so that the\\n5 200 basis points are evenly apportioned among\\n6 each percentage point value between 100% and\\n7 134% achievement.\\n8 (C) Notwithstanding the provisions of\\n9 subparagraphs (A) and (B) of this paragraph (7), if\\n10 the applicable annual incremental goal for an electric\\n11 utility is ever less than 0.6% of deemed average\\n12 weather normalized sales of electric power and energy\\n13 during calendar years 2014, 2015, and 2016, an\\n14 adjustment to the return on equity component of the\\n15 utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital calculated\\n16 under subsection (d) of this Section shall be made as\\n17 follows:\\n18 (i) If the independent evaluator determines\\n19 that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting\\n20 annual savings that is less than would have been\\n21 achieved had the applicable annual incremental\\n22 goal been achieved, then the return on equity\\n23 component shall be reduced by a maximum of 200\\n24 basis points if the utility achieved no more than\\n25 75% of its applicable annual total savings\\n26 requirement as defined in paragraph (7.5) of thisHB0804 - 563 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subsection. If the utility achieved more than 75%\\n2 of the applicable annual total savings requirement\\n3 but less than 100% of such goal, then the return on\\n4 equity component shall be reduced by 8 basis\\n5 points for each percent by which the utility\\n6 failed to achieve the goal.\\n7 (ii) If the independent evaluator determines\\n8 that the utility achieved a cumulative persisting\\n9 annual savings that is more than would have been\\n10 achieved had the applicable annual incremental\\n11 goal been achieved, then the return on equity\\n12 component shall be increased by a maximum of 200\\n13 basis points if the utility achieved at least 125%\\n14 of its applicable annual total savings\\n15 requirement. If the utility achieved more than\\n16 100% of the applicable annual total savings\\n17 requirement but less than 125% of such goal, then\\n18 the return on equity component shall be increased\\n19 by 8 basis points for each percent by which the\\n20 utility achieved above the applicable annual total\\n21 savings requirement. If the applicable annual\\n22 incremental goal was reduced under paragraphs (1)\\n23 or (2) of subsection (f) of this Section, then the\\n24 following adjustments shall be made to the\\n25 calculations described in this item (ii):\\n26 (aa) the calculation for determiningHB0804 - 564 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 achievement that is at least 125% of the\\n2 applicable annual total savings requirement\\n3 shall use the unreduced applicable annual\\n4 incremental goal to set the value; and\\n5 (bb) the calculation for determining\\n6 achievement that is less than 125% but more\\n7 than 100% of the applicable annual total\\n8 savings requirement shall use the reduced\\n9 applicable annual incremental goal to set the\\n10 value for 100% achievement of the goal and\\n11 shall use the unreduced goal to set the value\\n12 for 125% achievement. The 8 basis point value\\n13 shall also be modified, as necessary, so that\\n14 the 200 basis points are evenly apportioned\\n15 among each percentage point value between 100%\\n16 and 125% achievement.\\n17 (7.5) For purposes of this Section, the term\\n18 \"applicable annual incremental goal\" means the difference\\n19 between the cumulative persisting annual savings goal for\\n20 the calendar year that is the subject of the independent\\n21 evaluator\\'s determination and the cumulative persisting\\n22 annual savings goal for the immediately preceding calendar\\n23 year, as such goals are defined in subsections (b-5) and\\n24 (b-15) of this Section and as these goals may have been\\n25 modified as provided for under subsection (b-20) and\\n26 paragraphs (1) through (3) of subsection (f) of thisHB0804 - 565 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Section. Under subsections (b), (b-5), (b-10), and (b-15)\\n2 of this Section, a utility must first replace energy\\n3 savings from measures that have expired reached the end of\\n4 their measure lives and would otherwise have to be\\n5 replaced to meet the applicable savings goals identified\\n6 in subsection (b-5) or (b-15) of this Section before any\\n7 progress towards achievement of its applicable annual\\n8 incremental goal may be counted. Savings may expire\\n9 because measures installed in previous years have reached\\n10 the end of their lives, because measures installed in\\n11 previous years are producing lower savings in the current\\n12 year than in the previous year, or for other reasons\\n13 identified by independent evaluators. Notwithstanding\\n14 anything else set forth in this Section, the difference\\n15 between the actual annual incremental savings achieved in\\n16 any given year, including the replacement of energy\\n17 savings from measures that have expired, and the\\n18 applicable annual incremental goal shall not affect\\n19 adjustments to the return on equity for subsequent\\n20 calendar years under this subsection (g).\\n21 In this Section, \"applicable annual total savings\\n22 requirement\" means the total amount of new annual savings\\n23 that the utility must achieve in any given year to achieve\\n24 the applicable annual incremental goal. This is equal to\\n25 the applicable annual incremental goal plus the total new\\n26 annual savings that are required to replace savings thatHB0804 - 566 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 expired in or at the end of the previous year.\\n2 (8) For electric utilities that serve less than\\n3 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail\\n4 customers in the State:\\n5 (A) Through December 31, 2025, the applicable\\n6 annual incremental goal shall be compared to the\\n7 annual incremental savings as determined by the\\n8 independent evaluator.\\n9 (i) The return on equity component shall be\\n10 reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by\\n11 which the utility did not achieve 84.4% of the\\n12 applicable annual incremental goal.\\n13 (ii) The return on equity component shall be\\n14 increased by 8 basis points for each percent by\\n15 which the utility exceeded 100% of the applicable\\n16 annual incremental goal.\\n17 (iii) The return on equity component shall not\\n18 be increased or decreased if the annual\\n19 incremental savings as determined by the\\n20 independent evaluator is greater than 84.4% of the\\n21 applicable annual incremental goal and less than\\n22 100% of the applicable annual incremental goal.\\n23 (iv) The return on equity component shall not\\n24 be increased or decreased by an amount greater\\n25 than 200 basis points pursuant to this\\n26 subparagraph (A).HB0804 - 567 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (B) For the period of January 1, 2026 through\\n2 December 31, 2029 and in all subsequent 4-year periods\\n3 2030, the applicable annual incremental goal shall be\\n4 compared to the annual incremental savings as\\n5 determined by the independent evaluator.\\n6 (i) The return on equity component shall be\\n7 reduced by 6 basis points for each percent by\\n8 which the utility did not achieve 100% of the\\n9 applicable annual incremental goal.\\n10 (ii) The return on equity component shall be\\n11 increased by 6 basis points for each percent by\\n12 which the utility exceeded 100% of the applicable\\n13 annual incremental goal.\\n14 (iii) The return on equity component shall not\\n15 be increased or decreased by an amount greater\\n16 than 200 basis points pursuant to this\\n17 subparagraph (B).\\n18 (C) Notwithstanding provisions in subparagraphs\\n19 (A) and (B) of paragraph (7) of this subsection, if the\\n20 applicable annual incremental goal for an electric\\n21 utility is ever less than 0.6% of deemed average\\n22 weather normalized sales of electric power and energy\\n23 during calendar years 2014, 2015 and 2016, an\\n24 adjustment to the return on equity component of the\\n25 utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital calculated\\n26 under subsection (d) of this Section shall be made asHB0804 - 568 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 follows:\\n2 (i) The return on equity component shall be\\n3 reduced by 8 basis points for each percent by\\n4 which the utility did not achieve 100% of the\\n5 applicable annual total savings requirement.\\n6 (ii) The return on equity component shall be\\n7 increased by 8 basis points for each percent by\\n8 which the utility exceeded 100% of the applicable\\n9 annual total savings requirement.\\n10 (iii) The return on equity component shall not\\n11 be increased or decreased by an amount greater\\n12 than 200 basis points pursuant to this\\n13 subparagraph (C).\\n14 (D) (C) If the applicable annual incremental goal\\n15 was reduced under paragraphs (1), (2), or (3), or (4)\\n16 of subsection (f) of this Section, then the following\\n17 adjustments shall be made to the calculations\\n18 described in subparagraphs (A), and (B), and (C) of\\n19 this paragraph (8):\\n20 (i) The calculation for determining\\n21 achievement that is at least 125% or 134%, as\\n22 applicable, of the applicable annual incremental\\n23 goal or the applicable annual total savings\\n24 requirement, as applicable, shall use the\\n25 unreduced applicable annual incremental goal to\\n26 set the value.HB0804 - 569 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (ii) For the period through December 31, 2025,\\n2 the calculation for determining achievement that\\n3 is less than 125% but more than 100% of the\\n4 applicable annual incremental goal or the\\n5 applicable annual total savings requirement, as\\n6 applicable, shall use the reduced applicable\\n7 annual incremental goal to set the value for 100%\\n8 achievement of the goal and shall use the\\n9 unreduced goal to set the value for 125%\\n10 achievement. The 8 basis point value shall also be\\n11 modified, as necessary, so that the 200 basis\\n12 points are evenly apportioned among each\\n13 percentage point value between 100% and 125%\\n14 achievement.\\n15 (iii) For the period of January 1, 2026\\n16 through December 31, 2029 and all subsequent\\n17 4-year periods, the calculation for determining\\n18 achievement that is less than 125% or 134%, as\\n19 applicable, but more than 100% of the applicable\\n20 annual incremental goal or the applicable annual\\n21 total savings requirement, as applicable, shall\\n22 use the reduced applicable annual incremental goal\\n23 to set the value for 100% achievement of the goal\\n24 and shall use the unreduced goal to set the value\\n25 for 125% achievement. The 6 or 8 basis point\\n26 values, as applicable, shall also be modified, asHB0804 - 570 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 necessary, so that the 200 basis points are evenly\\n2 apportioned among each percentage point value\\n3 between 100% and 125% or between 100% and 134%\\n4 achievement, as applicable 2030, the calculation\\n5 for determining achievement that is less than 134%\\n6 but more than 100% of the applicable annual\\n7 incremental goal shall use the reduced applicable\\n8 annual incremental goal to set the value for 100%\\n9 achievement of the goal and shall use the\\n10 unreduced goal to set the value for 125%\\n11 achievement. The 6 basis point value shall also be\\n12 modified, as necessary, so that the 200 basis\\n13 points are evenly apportioned among each\\n14 percentage point value between 100% and 134%\\n15 achievement.\\n16 (9) The utility shall submit the energy savings data\\n17 to the independent evaluator no later than 30 days after\\n18 the close of the plan year. The independent evaluator\\n19 shall determine the cumulative persisting annual savings\\n20 for a given plan year, as well as an estimate of job\\n21 impacts and other macroeconomic impacts of the efficiency\\n22 programs for that year, no later than 120 days after the\\n23 close of the plan year. The utility shall submit an\\n24 informational filing to the Commission no later than 160\\n25 days after the close of the plan year that attaches the\\n26 independent evaluator\\'s final report identifying theHB0804 - 571 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 cumulative persisting annual savings for the year and\\n2 calculates, under paragraph (7) or (8) of this subsection\\n3 (g), as applicable, any resulting change to the utility\\'s\\n4 return on equity component of the weighted average cost of\\n5 capital applicable to the next plan year beginning with\\n6 the January monthly billing period and extending through\\n7 the December monthly billing period. However, if the\\n8 utility recovers the costs incurred under this Section\\n9 under paragraphs (2) and (3) of subsection (d) of this\\n10 Section, then the utility shall not be required to submit\\n11 such informational filing, and shall instead submit the\\n12 information that would otherwise be included in the\\n13 informational filing as part of its filing under paragraph\\n14 (3) of such subsection (d) that is due on or before June 1\\n15 of each year.\\n16 For those utilities that must submit the informational\\n17 filing, the Commission may, on its own motion or by\\n18 petition, initiate an investigation of such filing,\\n19 provided, however, that the utility\\'s proposed return on\\n20 equity calculation shall be deemed the final, approved\\n21 calculation on December 15 of the year in which it is filed\\n22 unless the Commission enters an order on or before\\n23 December 15, after notice and hearing, that modifies such\\n24 calculation consistent with this Section.\\n25 The adjustments to the return on equity component\\n26 described in paragraphs (7) and (8) of this subsection (g)HB0804 - 572 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 shall be applied as described in such paragraphs through a\\n2 separate tariff mechanism, which shall be filed by the\\n3 utility under subsections (f) and (g) of this Section.\\n4 (9.5) The utility must demonstrate how it will ensure\\n5 that program implementation contractors and energy\\n6 efficiency installation vendors will meet multiple\\n7 workforce equity building criteria, including, but not\\n8 limited to:\\n9 (i) Ensuring that an amount of program portfolio\\n10 incentive funding proportional to the population of\\n11 BIPOC persons within the utility\\'s territory, as\\n12 updated every 2 years, is administered or installed by\\n13 energy efficiency installation vendors who meet one of\\n14 the following criteria:\\n15 (aa) certified under Section 2 of the Business\\n16 Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with\\n17 Disabilities Act; or\\n18 (bb) certified by another municipal, state,\\n19 federal, or other certification for disadvantaged\\n20 businesses; or\\n21 (cc) submit an affidavit showing that the\\n22 vendor meets the eligibility criteria for a\\n23 certification program such as those in subdivision\\n24 (aa) or (bb); or\\n25 (dd) if the vendor is a nonprofit, meet any of\\n26 the criteria in subdivision (aa), (bb), or (cc) orHB0804 - 573 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 is controlled by a board of directors that\\n2 consists of 51% or greater individuals who are\\n3 minorities, women, or persons with a disability as\\n4 defined by the Business Enterprise for Minorities,\\n5 Women, and Persons with a Disability Act.\\n6 (ii) Ensuring that program implementation\\n7 contractors and energy efficiency installation vendors\\n8 pay employees working on energy efficiency programs at\\n9 or above the prevailing wage rate when such a wage rate\\n10 has been published by the Illinois Department of Labor\\n11 and pay employees working on energy efficiency\\n12 programs at or above the median wage rate for a similar\\n13 job description in the nearest metropolitan area when\\n14 there is no applicable published prevailing wage rate.\\n15 If necessary, utilities may conduct surveys to\\n16 establish the median wage rate for a given job\\n17 description. Utilities shall establish reporting\\n18 procedures for vendors that ensure compliance with\\n19 this subsection, but are structured to avoid, wherever\\n20 possible, placing an undue administrative burden on\\n21 vendors.\\n22 (iii) Ensuring that program implementation\\n23 contractor employees and energy efficiency\\n24 installation vendor employees are proportional to the\\n25 population of BIPOC persons, within the utility\\'s\\n26 territory, as updated every 2 years.HB0804 - 574 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (iv) Ensuring that 30% or more of the energy\\n2 efficiency installation vendor employees working for\\n3 vendors reporting to each program implementation\\n4 contractor are graduates of or trainees in the Clean\\n5 Energy Workforce Training Hubs programs, Returning\\n6 Residents Clean Jobs training programs, or similar\\n7 programs offering equivalent certifications.\\n8 (v) Ensuring that vendors who are very small\\n9 businesses of 5 or fewer full-time employees,\\n10 businesses that have completed or are participating in\\n11 the Expanding Clean Energy Entrepreneurship and\\n12 Contractor Incubator Network Program, and businesses\\n13 that have completed or are participating in the\\n14 Illinois Clean Energy Black, Indigenous, and People of\\n15 Color Primes Contractor Accelerator, receive a\\n16 substantial portion of program portfolio funding.\\n17 Utility plans to achieve this shall include efforts to\\n18 provide the necessary training and administrative\\n19 support needed for very small businesses to meet\\n20 utility-mandated training, certification, insurance,\\n21 and security-related contract requirements.\\n22 (9.6) Utilities shall collect data necessary to ensure\\n23 compliance with paragraph (9.5) no less than quarterly and\\n24 shall communicate progress toward compliance with\\n25 paragraph (9.5) to program implementation contractors and\\n26 energy efficiency installation vendors no less thanHB0804 - 575 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 quarterly. When it seems unlikely that the criteria in\\n2 paragraph (9.5) will be met, utilities shall work with\\n3 relevant vendors, providing education, training, and other\\n4 resources needed to ensure compliance and, where\\n5 necessary, adjusting or terminating work with vendors that\\n6 cannot assist with compliance.\\n7 (10) Utilities required to implement efficiency\\n8 programs under subsections (b-5) and (b-10) shall report\\n9 annually to the Illinois Commerce Commission and the\\n10 General Assembly on how hiring, contracting, job training,\\n11 and other practices related to its energy efficiency\\n12 programs enhance the diversity of vendors working on such\\n13 programs. These reports must include data on vendor and\\n14 employee diversity, including data on the implementation\\n15 of paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6). If the utility is not\\n16 meeting the requirements of paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6),\\n17 the utility shall submit a plan to adjust their activities\\n18 so that they meet the requirements of paragraphs (9.5) and\\n19 (9.6) within the following year.\\n20 (h) No more than 6% of energy efficiency and\\n21 demand-response program revenue may be allocated for research,\\n22 development, or pilot deployment of new equipment or measures.\\n23 (i) When practicable, electric utilities shall incorporate\\n24 advanced metering infrastructure data into the planning,\\n25 implementation, and evaluation of energy efficiency measures\\n26 and programs, subject to the data privacy and confidentialityHB0804 - 576 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 protections of applicable law.\\n2 (j) The independent evaluator shall follow the guidelines\\n3 and use the savings set forth in Commission-approved energy\\n4 efficiency policy manuals and technical reference manuals, as\\n5 each may be updated from time to time. Until such time as\\n6 measure life values for energy efficiency measures implemented\\n7 for low-income households under subsection (c) of this Section\\n8 are incorporated into such Commission-approved manuals, the\\n9 low-income measures shall have the same measure life values\\n10 that are established for same measures implemented in\\n11 households that are not low-income households.\\n12 (k) Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary,\\n13 an electric utility subject to the requirements of this\\n14 Section may file a tariff cancelling an automatic adjustment\\n15 clause tariff in effect under this Section or Section 8-103,\\n16 which shall take effect no later than one business day after\\n17 the date such tariff is filed. Thereafter, the utility shall\\n18 be authorized to defer and recover its expenditures incurred\\n19 under this Section through a new tariff authorized under\\n20 subsection (d) of this Section or in the utility\\'s next rate\\n21 case under Article IX or Section 16-108.5 of this Act, with\\n22 interest at an annual rate equal to the utility\\'s weighted\\n23 average cost of capital as approved by the Commission in such\\n24 case. If the utility elects to file a new tariff under\\n25 subsection (d) of this Section, the utility may file the\\n26 tariff within 10 days after June 1, 2017 (the effective date ofHB0804 - 577 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Public Act 99-906), and the cost inputs to such tariff shall be\\n2 based on the projected costs to be incurred by the utility\\n3 during the calendar year in which the new tariff is filed and\\n4 that were not recovered under the tariff that was cancelled as\\n5 provided for in this subsection. Such costs shall include\\n6 those incurred or to be incurred by the utility under its\\n7 multi-year plan approved under subsections (f) and (g) of this\\n8 Section, including, but not limited to, projected capital\\n9 investment costs and projected regulatory asset balances with\\n10 correspondingly updated depreciation and amortization reserves\\n11 and expense. The Commission shall, after notice and hearing,\\n12 approve, or approve with modification, such tariff and cost\\n13 inputs no later than 75 days after the utility filed the\\n14 tariff, provided that such approval, or approval with\\n15 modification, shall be consistent with the provisions of this\\n16 Section to the extent they do not conflict with this\\n17 subsection (k). The tariff approved by the Commission shall\\n18 take effect no later than 5 days after the Commission enters\\n19 its order approving the tariff.\\n20 No later than 60 days after the effective date of the\\n21 tariff cancelling the utility\\'s automatic adjustment clause\\n22 tariff, the utility shall file a reconciliation that\\n23 reconciles the moneys collected under its automatic adjustment\\n24 clause tariff with the costs incurred during the period\\n25 beginning June 1, 2016 and ending on the date that the electric\\n26 utility\\'s automatic adjustment clause tariff was cancelled. InHB0804 - 578 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the event the reconciliation reflects an under-collection, the\\n2 utility shall recover the costs as specified in this\\n3 subsection (k). If the reconciliation reflects an\\n4 over-collection, the utility shall apply the amount of such\\n5 over-collection as a one-time credit to retail customers\\'\\n6 bills.\\n7 (l) (Blank). For the calendar years covered by a\\n8 multi-year plan commencing after December 31, 2017,\\n9 subsections (a) through (j) of this Section do not apply to any\\n10 retail customers of an electric utility that serves more than\\n11 3,000,000 retail customers in the State and whose total\\n12 highest 30 minute demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts, or\\n13 any retail customers of an electric utility that serves less\\n14 than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than 500,000 retail\\n15 customers in the State and whose total highest 15 minute\\n16 demand was more than 10,000 kilowatts. For purposes of this\\n17 subsection (l), \"retail customer\" has the meaning set forth in\\n18 Section 16-102 of this Act. A determination of whether this\\n19 subsection is applicable to a customer shall be made for each\\n20 multi-year plan beginning after December 31, 2017. The\\n21 criteria for determining whether this subsection (l) is\\n22 applicable to a retail customer shall be based on the 12\\n23 consecutive billing periods prior to the start of the first\\n24 year of each such multi-year plan.\\n25 (m) Notwithstanding the requirements of this Section, as\\n26 part of a proceeding to approve a multi-year plan underHB0804 - 579 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subsections (f) and (g) of this Section if the multi-year plan\\n2 has been designed to maximize savings, but does not meet the\\n3 cost cap limitations of this subsection, the Commission shall\\n4 reduce the amount of energy efficiency measures implemented\\n5 for any single year, and whose costs are recovered under\\n6 subsection (d) of this Section, by an amount necessary to\\n7 limit the estimated average net increase due to the cost of the\\n8 measures to no more than\\n9 (1) 3.5% for each of the 4 years beginning January 1,\\n10 2018,\\n11 (2) (blank), 3.75% for each of the 4 years beginning\\n12 January 1, 2022, and\\n13 (3) 4% for each of the 4 5 years beginning January 1,\\n14 2022 2026,\\n15 (4) 4.25% for the 4 years beginning January 1, 2026,\\n16 and\\n17 (5) 4.25% plus an increase sufficient to account for\\n18 the rate of inflation between January 1, 2026 and January\\n19 1 of the first year of each subsequent 4-year plan cycle,\\n20 of the average amount paid per kilowatthour by residential\\n21 eligible retail customers during calendar year 2015. An\\n22 electric utility may plan to spend up to 10% more in any year\\n23 during an applicable multi-year plan period to\\n24 cost-effectively achieve additional savings so long as the\\n25 average over the applicable multi-year plan period does not\\n26 exceed the percentages defined in items (1) through (5). ToHB0804 - 580 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 determine the total amount that may be spent by an electric\\n2 utility in any single year, the applicable percentage of the\\n3 average amount paid per kilowatthour shall be multiplied by\\n4 the total amount of energy delivered by such electric utility\\n5 in the calendar year 2015, adjusted to reflect the proportion\\n6 of the utility\\'s load attributable to customers who are exempt\\n7 from subsections (a) through (j) of this Section under\\n8 subsection (l) of this Section. For purposes of this\\n9 subsection (m), the amount paid per kilowatthour includes,\\n10 without limitation, estimated amounts paid for supply,\\n11 transmission, distribution, surcharges, and add-on taxes. For\\n12 purposes of this Section, \"eligible retail customers\" shall\\n13 have the meaning set forth in Section 16-111.5 of this Act.\\n14 Once the Commission has approved a plan under subsections (f)\\n15 and (g) of this Section, no subsequent rate impact\\n16 determinations shall be made.\\n17 (Source: P.A. 100-840, eff. 8-13-18; 101-81, eff. 7-12-19.)\\n18 (220 ILCS 5/8-104.1 new)\\n19 Sec. 8-104.1. Gas utilities; annual savings goals.\\n20 (a) It is the policy of the State that gas utilities are\\n21 required to use cost-effective energy efficiency to reduce\\n22 delivery load. Requiring investment in cost-effective energy\\n23 efficiency will reduce direct and indirect costs to consumers\\n24 by decreasing environmental impacts and by reducing the amount\\n25 of natural gas that needs to be purchased and avoiding orHB0804 - 581 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 delaying the need for new transmission, distribution, storage\\n2 and other related infrastructure. It serves the public\\n3 interest to allow gas utilities to recover costs for\\n4 reasonably and prudently incurred expenditures for energy\\n5 efficiency measures.\\n6 (b) In this Section:\\n7 \"Cost-effective\" means that the measures satisfy the total\\n8 resource cost test that, for purposes of this Section, means a\\n9 standard that is met if, for an investment in energy\\n10 efficiency, the benefit-cost ratio is greater than one. The\\n11 benefit-cost ratio is the ratio of the net present value of the\\n12 total benefits of the measures to the net present value of the\\n13 total costs as calculated over the lifetime of the measures.\\n14 The total resource cost test compares the sum of avoided\\n15 natural gas utility costs, representing the benefits that\\n16 accrue to the natural gas system and the participant in the\\n17 delivery of those efficiency measures and including avoided\\n18 costs associated with the use of electricity or other fuels,\\n19 avoided cost associated with reduced water consumption, and\\n20 avoided costs associated with reduced operation and\\n21 maintenance costs, as well as other quantifiable societal\\n22 benefits, to the sum of all incremental costs of end-use\\n23 measures (including both utility and participant\\n24 contributions), plus costs to administer, deliver, and\\n25 evaluate each demand-side measure, to quantify the net savings\\n26 obtained by substituting demand-side measures for supplyHB0804 - 582 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 resources. In calculating avoided costs, reasonable estimates\\n2 shall be included for financial costs likely to be imposed by\\n3 future regulation of emissions of greenhouse gases. In\\n4 discounting future societal costs and benefits for the purpose\\n5 of calculating net present values, a societal discount rate\\n6 based on actual, long-term Treasury bond yields shall be used.\\n7 The low-income measures described in subsection (f) of this\\n8 Section shall not be required to meet the total resource cost\\n9 test.\\n10 \"Cumulative persisting annual savings\" means the total gas\\n11 energy savings in a given year from measures installed in that\\n12 year or in previous years, but no earlier than January 1, 2022,\\n13 that are still operational and providing savings in that year\\n14 because the measures have not yet reached the end of their\\n15 useful lives.\\n16 \"Energy efficiency\" means measures that reduce the amount\\n17 of energy required to achieve a given end use. \"Energy\\n18 efficiency\" also includes measures that reduce the total Btus\\n19 of electricity and natural gas needed to meet the end use or\\n20 uses. \"Black, indigenous, and people of color\" and \"BIPOC\"\\n21 means people who are members of the groups described in\\n22 subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph (A) of subsection\\n23 (1) of Section 2 of the Business Enterprise for Minorities,\\n24 Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act. \"Expanding Clean\\n25 Energy Entrepreneurship and Contractor Incubator Network\\n26 Program,\" \"Clean Energy Black, Indigenous, and People of ColorHB0804 - 583 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Primes Contractor Accelerator,\" \"Returning Resident Clean\\n2 Energy Training Program,\" and \"Clean Energy Workforce Training\\n3 Hubs Program\" are as set forth in the Clean Jobs, Workforce and\\n4 Contractor Equity Act.\\n5 (c) This Section applies to all gas distribution utilities\\n6 in the State for those multi-year plans that include energy\\n7 efficiency programs commencing after December 31, 2022.\\n8 (d) Beginning in 2023, gas utilities subject to this\\n9 Section shall achieve the following cumulative persisting\\n10 annual savings goals, as compared to a deemed baseline\\n11 equivalent to the utility\\'s average annual therm throughput in\\n12 2016 through 2020 through the implementation of energy\\n13 efficiency measures during the applicable year and in prior\\n14 years, but no earlier than January 1, 2023:\\n15 (1) 1.2% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n16 year ending December 31, 2023;\\n17 (2) 2.1% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n18 year ending December 31, 2024;\\n19 (3) 3.0% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n20 year ending December 31, 2025;\\n21 (4) 3.9% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n22 year ending December 31, 2026;\\n23 (5) 4.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n24 year ending December 31, 2027;\\n25 (6) 5.7% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n26 year ending December 31, 2028;HB0804 - 584 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (7) 6.6% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n2 year ending December 31, 2029;\\n3 (8) 7.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n4 year ending December 31, 2030;\\n5 (9) 8.2% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n6 year ending December 31, 2031;\\n7 (10) 9.0% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n8 year ending December 31, 2032;\\n9 (11) 9.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for the\\n10 year ending December 31, 2033;\\n11 (12) 10.6% cumulative persisting annual savings for\\n12 the year ending December 31, 2034;\\n13 (13) 11.4% cumulative persisting annual savings for\\n14 the year ending December 31, 2035;\\n15 (14) 12.1% cumulative persisting annual savings for\\n16 the year ending December 31, 2036; and\\n17 (15) 12.8% cumulative persisting annual savings for\\n18 the year ending December 31, 2037.\\n19 No later than December 31, 2025, the Illinois Commerce\\n20 Commission shall establish additional cumulative persisting\\n21 annual savings goals for the years 2037 through 2041. The\\n22 Commission shall also establish additional cumulative\\n23 persisting annual savings goals every 5 years thereafter to\\n24 ensure utilities always have goals that extend at least 11\\n25 years into the future. The cumulative persisting annual\\n26 savings goals beyond the year 2035 shall increase by 0.6HB0804 - 585 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 percentage points per year absent a Commission decision to\\n2 initiate a proceeding to consider establishing goals that\\n3 increase by more or less than that amount. Such a proceeding\\n4 must be conducted in accordance with the procedures described\\n5 in subsection (f) of this Section. If such a proceeding is\\n6 initiated, the cumulative persisting annual savings goals\\n7 established by the Commission through that proceeding shall\\n8 reflect the Commission\\'s best estimate of the maximum amount\\n9 of additional gas savings that are forecast to be\\n10 cost-effectively achievable unless such best estimates would\\n11 result in goals that represent less than 0.4 percentage point\\n12 annual increases in total cumulative persisting annual\\n13 savings. The Commission may only establish goals that\\n14 represent less than 0.4 percentage point annual increases in\\n15 cumulative persisting annual savings if it can demonstrate,\\n16 based on clear and convincing evidence, that 0.4 percentage\\n17 point increases are not cost-effectively achievable. The\\n18 Commission shall inform its decision based on an energy\\n19 efficiency potential study that conforms to the requirements\\n20 of subsection (j-5) of this Section.\\n21 (e) If a gas utility jointly offers an energy efficiency\\n22 measure or program with an electric utility under plans\\n23 approved under this Section and Section 8-103B of this Act,\\n24 the gas utility may continue offering the program, including\\n25 the electric energy efficiency measures, if the electric\\n26 utility discontinues funding the program. In that event, theHB0804 - 586 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 energy-savings value associated with such other fuels shall be\\n2 converted to gas energy savings on an equivalent Btu basis for\\n3 the premises. However, the gas utility shall prioritize\\n4 programs for low-income residential customers to the extent\\n5 practicable.

A minimum of 10% of the utility\\'s entire\\n24 portfolio funding level for a given year shall be used to\\n25 procure cost-effective energy efficiency measures from units\\n26 of local government, municipal corporations, school districts,HB0804 - 587 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 public housing, community college districts, and\\n2 nonprofit-owned buildings provided that a minimum percentage\\n3 of available funds shall be used to procure energy efficiency\\n4 from public housing, which percentage shall be equal to public\\n5 housing\\'s share of public building energy consumption.\\n6 The utilities shall also implement energy efficiency\\n7 measures targeted at low-income single-family and multifamily\\n8 households, which, as used in this Section, means households\\n9 at or below 80% of area median income, and expenditures to\\n10 implement the measures shall be no less than 25% of the\\n11 utility\\'s total efficiency portfolio budget.\\n12 At least 70% of spending on programs targeted at\\n13 low-income households shall go toward integrated whole\\n14 building efficiency programs, as defined in subsection (g), or\\n15 individual measures that reduce space heating needs through\\n16 improvements to the building envelope, heating distribution\\n17 systems, or heating system controls. In implementing these\\n18 programs, utilities shall ensure that thermal insulating\\n19 materials used in the building envelope do not contain any\\n20 substance that is a Category 1 respiratory sensitizer as\\n21 defined by Appendix A to 29 CFR 1910.1200 (Health Hazard\\n22 Criteria: A.4 Respiratory or Skin Sensitization) that was\\n23 intentionally added or is present at greater than 0.1% (1000\\n24 ppm) by weight in the product. Programs targeted at low-income\\n25 households, which address single-family and multifamily\\n26 buildings shall be treated such that forecast savings to beHB0804 - 588 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 achieved in each building type are approximately in\\n2 proportional to the magnitude of cost-effective energy\\n3 efficiency opportunities in these respective building types.\\n4 Each gas utility shall assess opportunities to implement\\n5 cost-effective energy efficiency measures and programs through\\n6 a public-housing authority or authorities located in its\\n7 service territory. If such opportunities are identified, the\\n8 utility shall propose such measures and programs to address\\n9 the opportunities. Expenditures to address such opportunities\\n10 shall be credited toward the minimum procurement and\\n11 expenditure requirements set forth in this subsection (f).\\n12 Implementation of energy efficiency measures and programs\\n13 targeted at low-income households shall be contracted, when it\\n14 is practical, to independent third parties that have\\n15 demonstrated capabilities to serve such households, with a\\n16 preference for not-for-profit entities and government agencies\\n17 that have existing relationships with or experience serving\\n18 low-income communities in the State.\\n19 Each gas utility shall develop and implement reporting\\n20 procedures that address and assist in determining the amount\\n21 of energy savings that can be applied to the low-income\\n22 procurement and expenditure requirements set forth in this\\n23 subsection (f). Each gas utility shall also track the types\\n24 and quantities or volumes of insulation and air sealing\\n25 materials, and their associated energy saving benefits,\\n26 installed in energy efficiency programs targeted at low-incomeHB0804 - 589 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 single-family and multifamily households.\\n2 Each gas utility shall implement a health and safety fund\\n3 of a minimum of 0.5% of the utility\\'s entire portfolio funding\\n4 level for a given year, that shall be used for the purpose of\\n5 making grants for technical assistance, construction,\\n6 reconstruction, improvement, or repair of buildings to\\n7 facilitate their participation in the energy efficiency\\n8 programs targeted at low-income single-family and multifamily\\n9 households. These funds may also be used for the purpose of\\n10 making grants for technical assistance, construction,\\n11 reconstruction, improvement, or repair of the following\\n12 buildings to facilitate their participation in the energy\\n13 efficiency programs created by this Section: (1) buildings\\n14 that are owned or operated by registered 501(c)(3) public\\n15 charities; and (2) day care centers, day care homes, or group\\n16 day care homes, as defined by 89 Ill.

The\\n10 subcommittees shall meet together at least twice per year.\\n11 There shall be a statewide leadership committee led by and\\n12 composed of community-based organizations that are\\n13 representative of BIPOC and environmental justice communities\\n14 and that includes equitable representation from BIPOC\\n15 communities. The leadership committee shall be composed of an\\n16 equal number of representatives from the 2 subcommittees.\\n17 The subcommittees shall address specific programs and\\n18 issues, with the leadership committee convening targeted\\n19 workgroups as needed. The leadership committee may elect to\\n20 work with an independent facilitator to solicit and organize\\n21 feedback, recommendations and meeting participation from a\\n22 wide variety of community-based stakeholders. If a facilitator\\n23 is used, they shall be fair and responsive to the needs of all\\n24 stakeholders involved in the committee.\\n25 All committee meetings must be accessible, with rotating\\n26 locations if meetings are held in-person, virtualHB0804 - 591 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 participation options, and materials and agendas circulated\\n2 well in advance.\\n3 There shall also be opportunities for direct input by\\n4 committee members outside of committee meetings, such as via\\n5 individual meetings, surveys, emails and calls, to ensure\\n6 robust participation by stakeholders with limited capacity and\\n7 ability to attend committee meetings. Committee meetings shall\\n8 emphasize opportunities to bundle and coordinate delivery of\\n9 low-income energy efficiency with other programs that serve\\n10 low-income communities, such as Solar for All and bill payment\\n11 assistance programs. Meetings shall include educational\\n12 opportunities for stakeholders to learn more about these\\n13 additional offerings, and the committee shall assist in\\n14 figuring out the best methods for coordinated delivery and\\n15 implementation of offerings when serving low-income\\n16 communities. The committee shall directly and equitably\\n17 influence and inform utility low-income and public-housing\\n18 energy efficiency programs and priorities.\\n19 Participating utilities shall implement recommendations\\n20 from the committee whenever possible. Participating utilities\\n21 shall track and report how input from the committee has led to\\n22 new approaches and changes in their energy efficiency\\n23 portfolios. This reporting shall occur at committee meetings\\n24 and in quarterly energy efficiency reports to the Stakeholder\\n25 Advisory Group and Illinois Commerce Commission, and other\\n26 relevant reporting mechanisms. Participating utilities shallHB0804 - 592 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 also report on relevant equity data and metrics requested by\\n2 the committee, such as energy burden data, geographic, racial,\\n3 and other relevant demographic data on where programs are\\n4 being delivered and what populations programs are serving.\\n5 The Illinois Commerce Commission shall oversee and have\\n6 relevant staff participate in the committee. The committee\\n7 shall have a budget of 0.25% of each utility\\'s entire\\n8 efficiency portfolio funding for a given year. The budget\\n9 shall be overseen by the Commission. The budget shall be used\\n10 to provide grants for community-based organizations serving on\\n11 the leadership committee, stipends for community-based\\n12 organizations participating in the committee, grants for\\n13 community-based organizations to do energy efficiency outreach\\n14 and education, and relevant meeting needs as determined by the\\n15 leadership committee. The education and outreach shall\\n16 include, but is not limited to, basic energy efficiency\\n17 education, information about low-income energy efficiency\\n18 programs, and information on the committee\\'s purpose,\\n19 structure, and activities.\\n20 (g) At least 50% of the entire efficiency program\\n21 portfolio budget shall be spent on any combination of (1)\\n22 heating energy savings from integrated, residential or\\n23 nonresidential, new or existing whole building efficiency\\n24 programs; and (2) individual heating measures in residential\\n25 or nonresidential buildings, new or existing, that reduce the\\n26 amount of space heating needs through improvements to theHB0804 - 593 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 efficiency of building envelopes (including, but not limited\\n2 to, insulation measures, efficient windows and air leakage\\n3 reduction), improvements to systems for distributing heat\\n4 (including, but not limited to, duct leakage reduction, duct\\n5 insulation or pipe insulation) in buildings, improvements to\\n6 ventilation systems (including, but not limited to heat\\n7 recovery ventilation and demand control ventilation measures)\\n8 or improvements to controls of heating equipment (including,\\n9 but not limited to, advanced thermostats). Spending on\\n10 efficient furnaces, efficient boilers, or other efficient\\n11 heating equipment measures outside of or separate from\\n12 integrated whole building efficiency programs is permitted\\n13 within the efficiency program portfolio, but does not count\\n14 toward the minimum spending requirement in this subsection\\n15 (g). Spending on integrated whole building efficiency programs\\n16 targeted to low-income customers, as well as spending on\\n17 individual building envelope, heating distribution system,\\n18 ventilation system and heating system control measures\\n19 installed in low-income homes does count toward this\\n20 requirement. The portion of portfolio spending on program\\n21 marketing, training of installers, audits of buildings,\\n22 inspections of work performed, and other administrative and\\n23 technical expenses that are clearly tied to promotion and\\n24 delivery of integrated whole building efficiency programs or\\n25 installation of individual building envelope, heating\\n26 distribution system, ventilation system or heating systemHB0804 - 594 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 control measures shall count toward this requirement. If this\\n2 minimum requirement is not met, any performance incentive\\n3 earned under paragraph (7) of subsection (j) should be reduced\\n4 by the percentage point level of shortfall in meeting this\\n5 requirement; if the utility is subject to a performance\\n6 penalty, then the magnitude of the penalty shall be increased\\n7 by the percentage point shortfall in meeting this requirement.\\n8 As used in this subsection (g), \"integrated whole building\\n9 efficiency programs\" means programs designed to optimize the\\n10 heating efficiency of buildings by comprehensively and\\n11 simultaneously addressing cost-effective energy-savings\\n12 opportunities associated with heating equipment, heating\\n13 distribution systems, heating system controls, ventilation\\n14 systems and building envelopes; such programs may be targeted\\n15 to existing buildings or to construction of new buildings.\\n16 (h) Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the\\n17 contrary, a utility providing approved energy efficiency\\n18 measures in the State shall be permitted to recover all\\n19 reasonable and prudently incurred costs of those measures from\\n20 all distribution system customers, provided that nothing in\\n21 this subsection (h) permits the double recovery of such costs\\n22 from customers.\\n23 (i) Beginning in 2022, each gas utility shall file an\\n24 energy efficiency plan with the Commission to meet the energy\\n25 efficiency standards for the next applicable multi-year period\\n26 beginning January 1 of the year following the filing,HB0804 - 595 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 according to the schedule set forth in paragraphs (1) through\\n2 (5) of this subsection (i).

Annual increases in cumulative persisting\\n21 annual savings goals during the applicable 4-year plan\\n22 period shall not be reduced to amounts that are less than\\n23 the maximum amount of cumulative persisting annual savings\\n24 that is forecast to be cost-effectively achievable during\\n25 the 4-year plan period. The Commission shall review any\\n26 proposed goal reduction as part of its review and approvalHB0804 - 599 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 of the utility\\'s proposed plan, taking into account the\\n2 results of the potential study required by subsection\\n3 (j-5) of this Section.\\n4 Each utility\\'s plan shall set forth the utility\\'s\\n5 proposals to meet the energy efficiency standards identified\\n6 in subsection (d). The Commission shall seek public comment on\\n7 the utility\\'s plan and shall issue an order approving or\\n8 disapproving each plan within 6 months after its submission.\\n9 If the Commission disapproves a plan, the Commission shall,\\n10 within 30 days, describe in detail the reasons for the\\n11 disapproval and describe a path by which the utility may file a\\n12 revised draft of the plan to address the Commission\\'s concerns\\n13 satisfactorily. If the utility does not refile with the\\n14 Commission within 60 days, the utility shall be subject to\\n15 penalties at a rate of $100,000 per day until the plan is\\n16 filed. This process shall continue, and penalties shall\\n17 accrue, until the utility has successfully filed a portfolio\\n18 of energy efficiency measures. Penalties shall be deposited\\n19 into the Energy Efficiency Trust Fund.\\n20 (j) In submitting proposed plans and funding levels under\\n21 subsection (i) of this Section to meet the savings goals\\n22 identified in subsection (d), the utility shall:\\n23 (1) Demonstrate that its proposed energy efficiency\\n24 measures will achieve the applicable requirements that are\\n25 identified in subsection (d) of this Section.\\n26 (2) Demonstrate consideration of program options forHB0804 - 600 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (A) advancing new building codes, appliance standards, and\\n2 municipal regulations governing existing and new building\\n3 efficiency improvements and (B) supporting efforts to\\n4 improve compliance with new building codes, appliance\\n5 standards and municipal regulations, as potentially\\n6 cost-effective means of acquiring energy savings to count\\n7 toward savings goals.\\n8 (3) Demonstrate that its overall portfolio of\\n9 measures, not including low-income programs described in\\n10 subsection (f) of this Section, is cost-effective using\\n11 the total resource cost test, complies with subsection (i)\\n12 of this Section and represents a diverse cross-section of\\n13 opportunities for customers of all rate classes, to\\n14 participate in the programs. Individual measures need not\\n15 be cost-effective.\\n16 (3.5) Demonstrate that the utility\\'s plan integrates\\n17 the delivery of energy efficiency programs with electric\\n18 efficiency programs and other efforts to address bill\\n19 payment issues, including, but not limited to, LIHEAP and\\n20 the Percent Income Payment Plan, to the extent such\\n21 integration is practical and has the potential to enhance\\n22 customer engagement, minimize market confusion, or reduce\\n23 administrative costs.\\n24 (4) Present a third-party energy efficiency\\n25 implementation program subject to the following\\n26 requirements:HB0804 - 601 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (A) Beginning with the year commencing January 1,\\n2 2024, gas utilities shall fund third-party energy\\n3 efficiency programs in an amount that is no less than\\n4 10% of total efficiency portfolio budgets per year.\\n5 (B) For the multi-year plans commencing on January\\n6 1, 2023, the utility shall conduct a solicitation\\n7 process during 2023 for purposes of requesting\\n8 proposals from third-party vendors for those\\n9 third-party energy efficiency programs to be offered\\n10 during one or more years of the last 2 years of the\\n11 2023 to 2025 plan period. For the solicitation\\n12 process, the utility shall identify the sector,\\n13 technology, or a geographic area for which it is\\n14 seeking requests for proposals. The solicitation\\n15 process must be for programs that fill gaps in the\\n16 utility\\'s program portfolio or target business\\n17 sectors, building types, geographies or other specific\\n18 parts of its customer base with initiatives that would\\n19 be more effective at reaching these customer segments\\n20 than the utilities\\' programs filed in its energy\\n21 efficiency plans.\\n22 (C) For multi-year plans commencing on January 1,\\n23 2026, January 1, 2030, and every 4 years thereafter,\\n24 the utility shall conduct a solicitation process\\n25 during 2025, 2029, and every 4 years thereafter,\\n26 respectively, for purposes of requesting proposalsHB0804 - 602 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 from third-party vendors for those third-party energy\\n2 efficiency programs to be offered during one or more\\n3 years of the respective multi-year plan period; for\\n4 each solicitation process, the utility shall identify\\n5 the sector, technology, or geographic area for which\\n6 it is seeking requests for proposals; the solicitation\\n7 process must be for programs that fill gaps in the\\n8 utility\\'s program portfolio or target business\\n9 sectors, building types, geographies or other specific\\n10 parts of its customer base with initiatives that would\\n11 be more effective at reaching these customer segments\\n12 than the utilities\\' programs filed in its energy\\n13 efficiency plans.\\n14 (D) The utility shall propose the bidder\\n15 qualifications, performance measurement process, and\\n16 contract structure, which must include a performance\\n17 payment mechanism and general terms and conditions;\\n18 the proposed qualifications, process, and structure\\n19 shall be subject to Commission approval.\\n20 (E) The utility shall retain an independent third\\n21 party to score the proposals received through the\\n22 solicitation process described in this paragraph (4),\\n23 rank them according to their cost per lifetime\\n24 kilowatt hours saved, and assemble the portfolio of\\n25 third-party programs.\\n26 The gas utility shall recover all costs associatedHB0804 - 603 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 with Commission-approved, third-party administered\\n2 programs regardless of the success of those programs.\\n3 (5) Include a proposed or revised cost-recovery\\n4 mechanism, as provided for under subsection (h) of this\\n5 Section, to fund the proposed energy efficiency measures\\n6 and to ensure the recovery of the prudently and reasonably\\n7 incurred costs of Commission-approved programs.\\n8 (6) Provide for an annual independent evaluation of\\n9 the performance of the cost-effectiveness of the utility\\'s\\n10 portfolio of measures, as well as a full review of the\\n11 multi-year plan results of the broader net program impacts\\n12 and, to the extent practical, for adjustment of the\\n13 measures on a going-forward basis as a result of the\\n14 evaluations. The resources dedicated to evaluation shall\\n15 not exceed 3% of portfolio resources in any given year.\\n16 (7) Each gas utility shall be eligible to earn a\\n17 shareholder incentive for effective implementation of its\\n18 efficiency programs. The incentive shall be tied to each\\n19 utility\\'s annual energy efficiency spending and its\\n20 savings relative to its applicable annual total savings\\n21 requirement as defined in paragraph (8) of this subsection\\n22 (j). There shall be no incentive if the independent\\n23 evaluator determines the utility failed to achieve savings\\n24 equal to at least 85% of its applicable annual total\\n25 savings requirement. The utility shall earn an incentive\\n26 equal 0.5% of total annual efficiency spending in the yearHB0804 - 604 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 being evaluated for every one percentage point above 85%\\n2 up to 100% of its applicable annual total savings\\n3 requirement that the utility achieved in that year, such\\n4 that the utility shall earn an incentive equal to 7.5% of\\n5 spending for meeting 100% of its applicable annual total\\n6 savings requirement. The utility shall earn an additional\\n7 0.3% of spending for every one percentage point above 100%\\n8 of its applicable annual total savings requirement\\n9 achieved, with a maximum incentive of 15% for achieving\\n10 125% of its applicable annual total savings requirement.\\n11 (7.5) In this Section, \"applicable annual incremental\\n12 goal\" means the difference between the cumulative\\n13 persisting annual savings goal for the calendar year that\\n14 is the subject of the independent evaluator\\'s\\n15 determination and the cumulative persisting annual savings\\n16 goal for the immediately preceding calendar year, as such\\n17 goals are defined in subsection (d) of this Section. Under\\n18 subsection (d) of this Section, a utility must first\\n19 replace energy savings from measures that have expired and\\n20 would otherwise have to be replaced to meet the applicable\\n21 savings goals identified in subsection (d) of this Section\\n22 before any progress toward achievement of its applicable\\n23 annual incremental goal may be counted. Savings may expire\\n24 because measures installed in previous years have reached\\n25 the end of their lives, because measures installed in\\n26 previous years are producing lower savings in the currentHB0804 - 605 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 year than in the previous year or for other reasons\\n2 identified by independent evaluators. Notwithstanding\\n3 anything else set forth in this Section, the difference\\n4 between the actual annual incremental savings achieved in\\n5 any given year, including the replacement of energy\\n6 savings that have expired, and the applicable annual\\n7 incremental goal shall not affect adjustments to the\\n8 return on equity for subsequent calendar years under this\\n9 subsection (j).\\n10 (8) In this Section, \"applicable annual total savings\\n11 requirement\" means the total amount of new annual savings\\n12 that the utility must achieve in any given year to achieve\\n13 the applicable annual incremental goal. This shall be\\n14 equal to the applicable annual incremental goal plus the\\n15 total new annual savings that are required to replace\\n16 savings that expired in or at the end of the previous year.\\n17 (9) The utility shall submit the energy-savings data\\n18 to the independent evaluator no later than 30 days after\\n19 the close of the plan year. The independent evaluator\\n20 shall determine the cumulative persisting annual savings\\n21 and the utility\\'s performance relative to its applicable\\n22 annual total savings requirement for a given plan year no\\n23 later than 120 days after the close of the plan year. The\\n24 independent evaluator must also estimate the job impacts\\n25 and other macroeconomic impacts of the utility\\'s\\n26 efficiency programs. The utility shall submit anHB0804 - 606 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 informational filing to the Commission no later than 160\\n2 days after the close of the plan year that attaches the\\n3 independent evaluator\\'s final report identifying the\\n4 cumulative persisting annual savings for the year and\\n5 calculates, under paragraph (7) of this subsection (j), as\\n6 applicable, the magnitude of any shareholder incentive\\n7 that the utility has earned.\\n8 (9.5) The utility must demonstrate how it will ensure\\n9 that program implementation contractors and energy\\n10 efficiency installation vendors will meet multiple\\n11 workforce equity building criteria, including, but not\\n12 limited to:\\n13 (i) Ensuring that an amount of program portfolio\\n14 incentive funding proportional to the population of\\n15 BIPOC persons within the utility\\'s territory, as\\n16 updated every 2 years, is administered or installed by\\n17 energy efficiency installation vendors who meet one of\\n18 the following criteria:\\n19 (aa) certified under Section 2 of the Business\\n20 Enterprise for Minorities, Women, and Persons with\\n21 Disabilities Act; or\\n22 (bb) certified by another municipal, state,\\n23 federal, or other certification for disadvantaged\\n24 businesses; or\\n25 (cc) submit an affidavit showing that the\\n26 vendor meets the eligibility criteria for aHB0804 - 607 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 certification program such as those in subdivision\\n2 (aa) or (bb); or\\n3 (dd) if the vendor is a nonprofit, meet any of\\n4 the criteria in subdivision (aa), (bb), or (cc) or\\n5 is controlled by a board of directors that\\n6 consists of 51% or greater BIPOC persons.\\n7 (ii) Ensuring that program implementation\\n8 contractors and energy efficiency installation vendors\\n9 pay employees working on energy efficiency programs at\\n10 or above the prevailing wage rate when such a wage rate\\n11 has been published by the Illinois Department of Labor\\n12 and pay employees working on energy efficiency\\n13 programs at or above the median wage rate for a similar\\n14 job description in the nearest metropolitan area when\\n15 there is no applicable published prevailing wage rate.\\n16 If necessary, utilities may conduct surveys to\\n17 establish the median wage rate for a given job\\n18 description. Utilities shall establish reporting\\n19 procedures for vendors that ensure compliance with\\n20 this subsection, but are structured to avoid, wherever\\n21 possible, placing an undue administrative burden on\\n22 vendors.\\n23 (iii) Ensuring that program implementation\\n24 contractor employees and energy efficiency\\n25 installation vendor employees are proportional to the\\n26 population of people of color, as defined inHB0804 - 608 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subparagraphs (a) through (e) of paragraph (A)(1) of\\n2 Section 2 of the Business Enterprise for Minorities,\\n3 Women, and Persons with Disabilities Act, within the\\n4 utility\\'s territory, as updated every 2 years.\\n5 (iv) Ensuring that 30% or more of the energy\\n6 efficiency installation vendor employees working for\\n7 vendors reporting to each program implementation\\n8 contractor are graduates of or trainees in the Clean\\n9 Energy Workforce Training Hubs programs, Returning\\n10 Residents Clean Jobs Training programs, or similar\\n11 programs offering equivalent certifications.\\n12 (v) Ensuring that vendors who are very small\\n13 businesses of 5 or fewer full-time employees,\\n14 businesses that have completed or are participating in\\n15 the Expanding Clean Energy Entrepreneurship and\\n16 Contractor Incubator Network Program, and businesses\\n17 that have completed or are participating in the\\n18 Illinois Clean Energy Black, Indigenous, and People of\\n19 Color Primes Contractor Accelerator, receive a\\n20 substantial portion of program portfolio funding.\\n21 Utility plans to achieve this shall include efforts to\\n22 provide the necessary training and administrative\\n23 support needed for very small businesses to meet\\n24 utility-mandated training, certification, insurance,\\n25 and security-related contract requirements.\\n26 (9.6) Utilities shall collect data necessary to ensureHB0804 - 609 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 compliance with paragraph (9.5) no less than quarterly and\\n2 shall communicate progress toward compliance with\\n3 paragraph (9.5) to program implementation contractors and\\n4 energy efficiency installation vendors no less than\\n5 quarterly. When it seems unlikely that the criteria in\\n6 paragraph (9.5) will be met, utilities shall work with\\n7 relevant vendors, providing education, training, and other\\n8 resources needed to ensure compliance and, where\\n9 necessary, adjusting or terminating work with vendors that\\n10 cannot assist with compliance.\\n11 (10) A utility required to implement efficiency\\n12 programs under this Section shall report annually to the\\n13 Illinois Commerce Commission and the General Assembly on\\n14 how hiring, contracting, job training, and other practices\\n15 related to its energy efficiency programs enhance the\\n16 diversity of vendors working on such programs. These\\n17 reports must include data on vendor and employee\\n18 diversity, including data on the implementation of\\n19 paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6). If the utility is not meeting\\n20 the requirements of paragraphs (9.5) and (9.6), the\\n21 utility shall submit a plan to adjust their activities so\\n22 that they meet the requirements of paragraphs (9.5) and\\n23 (9.6) within the following year.\\n24 (j-5) Energy efficiency potential study. An energy\\n25 efficiency potential study shall be commissioned and overseen\\n26 by the Illinois Commerce Commission. The potential study shallHB0804 - 610 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 be a dual fuel study, addressing both gas and electric\\n2 efficiency potential, such that the requirements both in this\\n3 subsection (j-5) and in subsection (f-5) of Section 8-103B are\\n4 met in an integrated and cost-efficient manner. The potential\\n5 study shall be designed and conducted with input from a\\n6 Potential Study Stakeholder Committee established by the\\n7 Commission. This Committee shall be composed of\\n8 representatives from each electric utility, the Illinois\\n9 Attorney General\\'s office, at least 2 environmental\\n10 stakeholders, at least one community-based organization, and\\n11 additional parties representing consumers.

Renewable energy access plan.\\n2 (a) It is the policy of this State to promote\\n3 cost-effective transmission system development that ensures\\n4 reliability of the electric transmission system, lowers carbon\\n5 emissions, minimizes long-term costs for consumers, and\\n6 supports the electric policy goals of this State.\\n7 The General Assembly finds that:\\n8 (1) Transmission planning, primarily for reliability\\n9 purposes, but also for economic and public policy reasons\\n10 is conducted by regional transmission organizations in\\n11 which transmission-owning Illinois utilities and other\\n12 stakeholders are members.\\n13 (2) Order No. 1000 of the Federal Energy Regulatory\\n14 Commission requires regional transmission organizations to\\n15 plan for transmission system needs in light of state\\n16 public policies, and to accept input from states during\\n17 the transmission system planning processes.\\n18 (3) The State of Illinois does not currently have a\\n19 comprehensive power and environmental policy planning\\n20 process to identify transmission infrastructure needs that\\n21 can serve as a vital input into the regional and\\n22 inter-regional transmission organization planning\\n23 processes conducted under Order No. 1000 and other laws.\\n24 (4) This State is an electricity generation and power\\n25 transmission hub, and can leverage that position to invest\\n26 in infrastructure that enables new and existing IllinoisHB0804 - 613 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 generators to meet the public policy goals of the State of\\n2 Illinois and of interconnected states while\\n3 cost-effectively supporting tens of thousands of jobs in\\n4 the renewable energy sector in this State.\\n5 (5) The nation cannot readily access this State\\'s\\n6 low-cost, clean electric power, and this State is hindered\\n7 in its ability to develop and support its low-carbon\\n8 economy and keep electricity prices low in Illinois and\\n9 interconnected states.\\n10 (6) Existing transmission infrastructure may constrain\\n11 the State\\'s achievement of 100% renewable energy by 2050,\\n12 a carbon-free power sector by 2030, and an expanded use of\\n13 electric vehicles in a just and equitable way.\\n14 (7) Transmission system congestion within this State\\n15 and the regional transmission organizations serving this\\n16 State limits the ability of this State\\'s existing and new\\n17 electric generation facilities that do not emit carbon\\n18 dioxide, including renewable energy resources and zero\\n19 emission facilities, to serve the public policy goals of\\n20 this State and other states, which constrains investment\\n21 in this State.\\n22 (8) Investment in infrastructure to support existing\\n23 and new electric generation facilities that do not emit\\n24 carbon dioxide, including renewable energy resources and\\n25 zero emission facilities, stimulates significant economic\\n26 development and job growth in this State, as well asHB0804 - 614 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 creates environmental and public health benefits in this\\n2 State.\\n3 (9) Creating a forward-looking plan for this State\\'s\\n4 electric transmission infrastructure, as opposed to\\n5 relying on case-by-case development and repeated marginal\\n6 upgrades, will achieve a lower-cost system for Illinois\\'\\n7 electricity customers. A forward-looking plan can also\\n8 help integrate and achieve a comprehensive set of\\n9 objectives and multiple state, regional, and national\\n10 policy goals.\\n11 (10) Alternatives to overhead electric transmission\\n12 lines can achieve cost-effective resolution of system\\n13 impacts, and warrant investigation of the circumstances\\n14 those alternatives should be considered and approved. The\\n15 alternatives are likely to be beneficial as investment in\\n16 electric transmission infrastructure moves forward.\\n17 (b) Consistent with the findings identified in subsection\\n18 (a), the Commission shall open an investigation to deliberate,\\n19 develop, and adopt a renewable energy access plan no later\\n20 than December 31, 2022.

Multi-year integrated grid plan.\\n17 (a) Findings and Purpose. The General Assembly finds that\\n18 better aligning regulated utility operations, expenditures and\\n19 investments with public benefit goals including safety;\\n20 reliability; efficiency; affordability; equity; emissions\\n21 reductions; and expansion of clean distributed energy\\n22 resources, is critical to ensuring that Illinois residents and\\n23 businesses do not suffer economic and environmental harm from\\n24 the State\\'s energy systems and to maximize the potential\\n25 benefits from utility expenditures. To that end, it is theHB0804 - 635 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 policy of the State of Illinois to promote inclusive,\\n2 comprehensive, transparent, cost-effective distribution\\n3 system planning that minimizes long-term costs for Illinois\\n4 customers and supports the achievement of state renewable\\n5 energy development and other clean energy, public health, and\\n6 environmental policy goals. Utility distribution system\\n7 expenditures, programs, investments and policies must be\\n8 evaluated in coordination with these goals. In particular, the\\n9 General Assembly finds that:\\n10 (1) Illinois\\' electricity distribution system must\\n11 cost-effectively integrate renewable energy resources,\\n12 including utility-scale renewable energy resources,\\n13 community renewable generation and distributed renewable\\n14 energy resources, support beneficial electrification\\n15 including electric vehicle use and adoption, promote\\n16 opportunities for third-party investment in\\n17 nontraditional, grid-related technologies and resources\\n18 such as batteries, solar photovoltaic panels and smart\\n19 thermostats, reduce energy usage generally and especially\\n20 during times of greatest reliance on fossil fuels, and\\n21 enhance customer engagement opportunities.\\n22 (2) Inclusive distribution system planning is an\\n23 essential tool for the Illinois Commerce Commission,\\n24 public utilities, and stakeholders to effectively\\n25 coordinate environmental, consumer, reliability and equity\\n26 goals at fair and reasonable costs, and for ensuringHB0804 - 636 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 transparent utility accountability for meeting those\\n2 goals.\\n3 (3) Any planning process should advance Illinois\\n4 energy policy goals while ensuring utility investments are\\n5 cost-effective. Such a process should maximize the sharing\\n6 of information, ensure robust stakeholder participation,\\n7 and recognize the responsibility of the utility to\\n8 ultimately manage the grid in a safe, reliable manner.\\n9 (4) Since the passage of the Energy Infrastructure\\n10 Modernization Act in 2011, Illinois consumers have\\n11 invested billions of dollars toward electric utility grid\\n12 modernization. In the absence of a transparent\\n13 distribution planning process, however, those investments\\n14 have not served customers\\' best interests, have failed to\\n15 promote the expansion of clean distributed energy\\n16 resources, and have failed to advance equity and\\n17 environmental justice.\\n18 (5) The traditional regulatory model rewards utilities\\n19 for increasing capital expenditures by basing allowed\\n20 revenues on the value of the rate base, resulting in an\\n21 incentive for ever-increasing capital investments. The\\n22 General Assembly is concerned that the existing regulatory\\n23 model does not align the interests of customers, the\\n24 State, and utilities because it does not encourage\\n25 utilities to systematically analyze and consider\\n26 nontraditional solutions to utility, customer and gridHB0804 - 637 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 needs that may be more efficient and cost effective, and\\n2 less environmentally harmful than traditional solutions.\\n3 Nontraditional solutions include distributed energy\\n4 resources owned or implemented by customers and\\n5 independent third parties, controllable load, beneficial\\n6 electrification, or rate design that rewards efficient\\n7 energy use, for example.\\n8 (6) The General Assembly also finds that Illinois\\n9 utilities\\' current processes for planning their\\n10 distribution system are not reasonably accessible or\\n11 transparent to individuals and communities who pay for and\\n12 are affected by the utilities\\' distribution system assets,\\n13 and that more inclusive and accessible distribution system\\n14 planning processes would be in the interests of all\\n15 Illinois residents, but especially those residents\\n16 historically most negatively impacted by unsafe or\\n17 environmentally harmful energy infrastructure.\\n18 (7) The General Assembly finds it would be beneficial\\n19 to require utilities to demonstrate how their spending\\n20 promotes identified state energy goals, such as\\n21 integrating renewable energy; empowering customers;\\n22 supporting electric vehicles, beneficial electrification\\n23 and energy storage; achieving equity goals; and\\n24 maintaining reliability.\\n25 The General Assembly therefore directs the utilities to\\n26 implement distribution system planning in order to accelerateHB0804 - 638 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 progress on Illinois clean energy and environmental goals and\\n2 hold electric utilities publicly accountable for their\\n3 performance.\\n4 (b) Definitions. As used in this Section:\\n5 \"Commission\" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.\\n6 \"Demand response\" means measures that decrease peak\\n7 electricity demand or shift demand from peak to off-peak\\n8 periods.\\n9 \"Distributed energy resources\" or \"DER\" means a wide range\\n10 of technologies that are located on the customer side of the\\n11 customer\\'s electric meter and can provide value to the\\n12 distribution system, including, but not limited to,\\n13 distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and\\n14 demand response technologies.\\n15 \"Environmental justice communities\" means the definition\\n16 of that term based on existing methodologies and findings,\\n17 used and as may be updated by the Illinois Power Agency and its\\n18 Program Administrator in the Illinois Solar for All Program.\\n19 (c) Application. This Section applies to electric\\n20 utilities serving more than 500,000 retail customers in the\\n21 State.\\n22 (d) Objectives.

The electricity provider shall\\n22 continue to carry over any excess kilowatt-hour credits\\n23 earned and apply those credits to subsequent billing\\n24 periods to offset any customer-generator consumption in\\n25 those billing periods until all credits are used or until\\n26 the end of the annualized period.HB0804 - 674 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (3) At the end of the year or annualized over the\\n2 period that service is supplied by means of net metering,\\n3 or in the event that the retail customer terminates\\n4 service with the electricity provider prior to the end of\\n5 the year or the annualized period, any remaining credits\\n6 in the customer\\'s account shall expire.\\n7 (e-5) An electricity provider shall provide electric\\n8 service to eligible customers who utilize net metering at\\n9 non-discriminatory rates that are identical, with respect to\\n10 rate structure, retail rate components, and any monthly\\n11 charges, to the rates that the customer would be charged if not\\n12 a net metering customer. An electricity provider shall not\\n13 charge net metering customers any fee or charge or require\\n14 additional equipment, insurance, or any other requirements not\\n15 specifically authorized by interconnection standards\\n16 authorized by the Commission, unless the fee, charge, or other\\n17 requirement would apply to other similarly situated customers\\n18 who are not net metering customers. The customer will remain\\n19 responsible for all taxes, fees, and utility delivery charges\\n20 that would otherwise be applicable to the net amount of\\n21 electricity used by the customer. Subsections (c) through (e)\\n22 of this Section shall not be construed to prevent an\\n23 arms-length agreement between an electricity provider and an\\n24 eligible customer that sets forth different prices, terms, and\\n25 conditions for the provision of net metering service,\\n26 including, but not limited to, the provision of theHB0804 - 675 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 appropriate metering equipment for non-residential customers.\\n2 (f) Notwithstanding the requirements of subsections (c)\\n3 through (e-5) of this Section, an electricity provider must\\n4 require dual-channel metering for customers operating eligible\\n5 renewable electrical generating facilities with a nameplate\\n6 rating up to 2,000 kilowatts and to whom the provisions of\\n7 neither subsection (d), (d-5), nor (e) of this Section apply.\\n8 In such cases, electricity charges and credits shall be\\n9 determined as follows:\\n10 (1) The electricity provider shall assess and the\\n11 customer remains responsible for all taxes, fees, and\\n12 utility delivery charges that would otherwise be\\n13 applicable to the gross amount of kilowatt-hours supplied\\n14 to the eligible customer by the electricity provider.\\n15 (2) Each month that service is supplied by means of\\n16 dual-channel metering, the electricity provider shall\\n17 compensate the eligible customer for any excess\\n18 kilowatt-hour credits at the electricity provider\\'s\\n19 avoided cost of electricity supply over the monthly period\\n20 or as otherwise specified by the terms of a power-purchase\\n21 agreement negotiated between the customer and electricity\\n22 provider.\\n23 (3) For all eligible net metering customers taking\\n24 service from an electricity provider under contracts or\\n25 tariffs employing hourly or time of use rates, any monthly\\n26 consumption of electricity shall be calculated accordingHB0804 - 676 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 to the terms of the contract or tariff to which the same\\n2 customer would be assigned to or be eligible for if the\\n3 customer was not a net metering customer. When those same\\n4 customer-generators are net generators during any discrete\\n5 hourly or time of use period, the net kilowatt-hours\\n6 produced shall be valued at the same price per\\n7 kilowatt-hour as the electric service provider would\\n8 charge for retail kilowatt-hour sales during that same\\n9 time of use period.\\n10 (g) For purposes of federal and State laws providing\\n11 renewable energy credits or greenhouse gas credits, the\\n12 eligible customer shall be treated as owning and having title\\n13 to the renewable energy attributes, renewable energy credits,\\n14 and greenhouse gas emission credits related to any electricity\\n15 produced by the qualified generating unit. The electricity\\n16 provider may not condition participation in a net metering\\n17 program on the signing over of a customer\\'s renewable energy\\n18 credits; provided, however, this subsection (g) shall not be\\n19 construed to prevent an arms-length agreement between an\\n20 electricity provider and an eligible customer that sets forth\\n21 the ownership or title of the credits.\\n22 (h) Within 120 days after the effective date of this\\n23 amendatory Act of the 95th General Assembly, the Commission\\n24 shall establish standards for net metering and, if the\\n25 Commission has not already acted on its own initiative,\\n26 standards for the interconnection of eligible renewableHB0804 - 677 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 generating equipment to the utility system. The\\n2 interconnection standards shall address any procedural\\n3 barriers, delays, and administrative costs associated with the\\n4 interconnection of customer-generation while ensuring the\\n5 safety and reliability of the units and the electric utility\\n6 system. The Commission shall consider the Institute of\\n7 Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Standard 1547 and\\n8 the issues of (i) reasonable and fair fees and costs, (ii)\\n9 clear timelines for major milestones in the interconnection\\n10 process, (iii) nondiscriminatory terms of agreement, and (iv)\\n11 any best practices for interconnection of distributed\\n12 generation.\\n13 (h-3) On and after the effective date of this amendatory\\n14 Act of the 102nd General Assembly, it is the policy of the\\n15 State that:\\n16 (1) Electric utilities must provide interconnection\\n17 customers with a detailed accounting of the components of\\n18 the utility\\'s cost to study and perform system upgrades,\\n19 with itemized lists of equipment costs, labor costs,\\n20 engineering costs, and administrative costs associated\\n21 with the study or system upgrade.\\n22 (2) An electric utility that has failed to meet an\\n23 interconnection timeline by more than 20 days is subject\\n24 to a penalty of $1,000 for each day over 20 days past the\\n25 applicable date upon which the utility action was due.\\n26 (3) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall, within 60HB0804 - 678 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 days after the effective date of this amendatory Act of\\n2 the 102nd General Assembly, hire or contract with an\\n3 independent grid engineer to address delays and disputes\\n4 between the utility and the interconnection customer.\\n5 Specifically, this independent engineer shall:\\n6 (A) review utility cost estimates at the request\\n7 of interconnection customers;\\n8 (B) resolve technical disputes between utilities\\n9 and interconnection customers regarding necessary\\n10 upgrades and costs thereof;\\n11 (C) authorize customers to self-supply\\n12 interconnection studies when the electric utility is\\n13 unable to provide such studies at a reasonable cost\\n14 and schedule; and\\n15 (D) authorize customers to self-build system\\n16 upgrades consistent with electric utility standards\\n17 when the electric utility cannot provide such upgrades\\n18 and interconnection facilities at a reasonable cost\\n19 and schedule.\\n20 The process to hire or contract with an independent\\n21 grid engineer described in this paragraph (3) is exempt\\n22 from the requirements of the Illinois Procurement Code,\\n23 pursuant to Section 20-10 of that Code.\\n24 (h-5) Within 90 days after the effective date of this\\n25 amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, the Commission\\n26 shall open a proceeding to update the interconnectionHB0804 - 679 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 standards and applicable utility tariffs.

The Commission shall make\\n4 available adequate Commission staff for this dispute\\n5 resolution process to ensure that matters are decided on\\n6 an expedited basis; and\\n7 (11) other policies, processes, tariffs, and standards\\n8 associated with interconnection, including the creation of\\n9 standards and processes that support the achievement of\\n10 the objectives in subparagraph (K) of paragraph (1) of\\n11 subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power\\n12 Agency Act\\n13 As part of this proceeding initiated under this subsection\\n14 (h-5), the Commission shall establish an interconnection\\n15 working group. The working group shall include representatives\\n16 from electric utilities, developers of renewable electric\\n17 generating facilities, representatives of interconnection\\n18 customers, Commission staff, and other stakeholders. The\\n19 working group shall be facilitated by Commission staff. The\\n20 working group shall examine and make recommendations regarding\\n21 best practices for interconnection process and customer\\n22 service for interconnecting customer adopting distributed\\n23 energy resources, including energy storage, interconnection of\\n24 new technologies, including smart inverters and energy\\n25 storage, and, without limitation, other technical, policy, and\\n26 tariff issues related to and affecting interconnectionHB0804 - 682 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 performance and customer service.\\n2 The working group shall report to the Commission on\\n3 changes to interconnection rules and tariffs and any other\\n4 recommendations as determined by the working group within 6\\n5 months after its first meeting. The report shall include\\n6 positions and recommendations of the working group and\\n7 individual working group members. The report of the working\\n8 group shall be entered into evidence in the rulemaking process\\n9 mandated by this subsection (h-5). The working group shall be\\n10 reconvened one year following the enactment of the rules\\n11 adopted pursuant to this subsection (h-5) to recommend any\\n12 additional changes and assess the performance of the rules in\\n13 meeting the goals as described above.\\n14 (i) All electricity providers shall begin to offer net\\n15 metering no later than April 1, 2008.\\n16 (j) An electricity provider shall provide net metering to\\n17 eligible customers until both of the following occur: (i) the\\n18 statewide net metering penetration equals 5% and (ii) the\\n19 Commission approves the utility tariffs prescribed by\\n20 subsection (e) of Section 16-107.6 of this Act that make\\n21 distributed generation rebates available to all eligible\\n22 customers, including residential customers, and those tariffs\\n23 go into effect. After that time the load of its net metering\\n24 customers equals 5% of the total peak demand supplied by that\\n25 electricity provider during the previous year. After such time\\n26 as the load of the electricity provider\\'s net meteringHB0804 - 683 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 customers equals 5% of the total peak demand supplied by that\\n2 electricity provider during the previous year, eligible\\n3 customers that begin taking net metering shall no longer be\\n4 eligible for netting of delivery service credits as described\\n5 in subsection (n) of this Section only be eligible for netting\\n6 of energy.\\n7 (k) Each electricity provider shall maintain records and\\n8 report annually to the Commission the total number of net\\n9 metering customers served by the provider, as well as the\\n10 type, capacity, and energy sources of the generating systems\\n11 used by the net metering customers. Nothing in this Section\\n12 shall limit the ability of an electricity provider to request\\n13 the redaction of information deemed by the Commission to be\\n14 confidential business information.\\n15 (l)(1) Notwithstanding the definition of \"eligible\\n16 customer\" in item (ii) of subsection (b) of this Section, each\\n17 electricity provider shall allow net metering as set forth in\\n18 this subsection (l) and for the following projects:\\n19 (A) properties owned or leased by multiple customers\\n20 that contribute to the operation of an eligible renewable\\n21 electrical generating facility through an ownership or\\n22 leasehold interest of at least 200 watts in such facility,\\n23 such as a community-owned wind project, a community-owned\\n24 biomass project, a community-owned solar project, or a\\n25 community methane digester processing livestock waste from\\n26 multiple sources, provided that the facility is alsoHB0804 - 684 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 located within the utility\\'s service territory;\\n2 (B) individual units, apartments, or properties\\n3 located in a single building that are owned or leased by\\n4 multiple customers and collectively served by a common\\n5 eligible renewable electrical generating facility, such as\\n6 an office or apartment building, a shopping center or\\n7 strip mall served by photovoltaic panels on the roof; and\\n8 (C) subscriptions to community renewable generation\\n9 projects, including community renewable generation\\n10 projects on the customer\\'s side of the billing meter of a\\n11 host facility and partially used for the customer\\'s own\\n12 load.\\n13 In addition, the nameplate capacity of the eligible\\n14 renewable electric generating facility that serves the demand\\n15 of the properties, units, or apartments identified in\\n16 paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (l) shall not exceed\\n17 2,000 kilowatts in nameplate capacity in total. Any eligible\\n18 renewable electrical generating facility or community\\n19 renewable generation project that is powered by photovoltaic\\n20 electric energy and installed after the effective date of this\\n21 amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly must be installed\\n22 by a qualified person in compliance with the requirements of\\n23 Section 16-128A of the Public Utilities Act and any rules or\\n24 regulations adopted thereunder.\\n25 (2) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, an\\n26 electricity provider shall provide credits for the electricityHB0804 - 685 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 produced by the projects described in paragraph (1) of this\\n2 subsection (l). The electricity provider shall provide credits\\n3 that include at least energy supply, capacity, transmission,\\n4 and the purchased electricity adjustment, as applicable, at\\n5 the subscriber\\'s energy supply rate on the subscriber\\'s\\n6 monthly bill equal to the subscriber\\'s share of the production\\n7 of electricity from the project, as determined by paragraph\\n8 (3) of this subsection (l).\\n9 (3) For the purposes of facilitating net metering, the\\n10 owner or operator of the eligible renewable electrical\\n11 generating facility or community renewable generation project\\n12 shall be responsible for determining the amount of the credit\\n13 that each customer or subscriber participating in a project\\n14 under this subsection (l) is to receive in the following\\n15 manner:\\n16 (A) The owner or operator shall, on a monthly basis,\\n17 provide to the electric utility the kilowatthours of\\n18 generation attributable to each of the utility\\'s retail\\n19 customers and subscribers participating in projects under\\n20 this subsection (l) in accordance with the customer\\'s or\\n21 subscriber\\'s share of the eligible renewable electric\\n22 generating facility\\'s or community renewable generation\\n23 project\\'s output of power and energy for such month. The\\n24 owner or operator shall electronically transmit such\\n25 calculations and associated documentation to the electric\\n26 utility, in a format or method set forth in the applicableHB0804 - 686 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 tariff, on a monthly basis so that the electric utility\\n2 can reflect the monetary credits on customers\\' and\\n3 subscribers\\' electric utility bills. The electric utility\\n4 shall be permitted to revise its tariffs to implement the\\n5 provisions of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General\\n6 Assembly this amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly.\\n7 The owner or operator shall separately provide the\\n8 electric utility with the documentation detailing the\\n9 calculations supporting the credit in the manner set forth\\n10 in the applicable tariff.\\n11 (B) For those participating customers and subscribers\\n12 who receive their energy supply from an alternative retail\\n13 electric supplier, the electric utility shall remit to the\\n14 applicable alternative retail electric supplier the\\n15 information provided under subparagraph (A) of this\\n16 paragraph (3) for such customers and subscribers in a\\n17 manner set forth in such alternative retail electric\\n18 supplier\\'s net metering program, or as otherwise agreed\\n19 between the utility and the alternative retail electric\\n20 supplier. The alternative retail electric supplier shall\\n21 then submit to the utility the amount of the charges for\\n22 power and energy to be applied to such customers and\\n23 subscribers, including the amount of the credit associated\\n24 with net metering.\\n25 (C) A participating customer or subscriber may provide\\n26 authorization as required by applicable law that directsHB0804 - 687 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the electric utility to submit information to the owner or\\n2 operator of the eligible renewable electrical generating\\n3 facility or community renewable generation project to\\n4 which the customer or subscriber has an ownership or\\n5 leasehold interest or a subscription. Such information\\n6 shall be limited to the components of the net metering\\n7 credit calculated under this subsection (l), including the\\n8 bill credit rate, total kilowatthours, and total monetary\\n9 credit value applied to the customer\\'s or subscriber\\'s\\n10 bill for the monthly billing period.\\n11 For community renewable generation projects located behind\\n12 the meter of a host facility, the determination of the\\n13 quantity of energy eligible for crediting to participating\\n14 customers or subscribers of the community renewable generation\\n15 project shall be based on any energy production of the project\\n16 that exceeds the host\\'s instantaneous on-site consumption\\n17 during the applicable billing period.\\n18 (l-5) Within 90 days after the effective date of this\\n19 amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly this amendatory\\n20 Act of the 99th General Assembly, each electric utility\\n21 subject to this Section shall file a tariff to implement the\\n22 provisions of subsection (l) of this Section, which shall,\\n23 consistent with the provisions of subsection (l), describe the\\n24 terms and conditions under which owners or operators of\\n25 qualifying properties, units, or apartments may participate in\\n26 net metering. The Commission shall approve, or approve withHB0804 - 688 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 modification, the tariff within 120 days after the effective\\n2 date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly this\\n3 amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly.\\n4 (m) Nothing in this Section shall affect the right of an\\n5 electricity provider to continue to provide, or the right of a\\n6 retail customer to continue to receive service pursuant to a\\n7 contract for electric service between the electricity provider\\n8 and the retail customer in accordance with the prices, terms,\\n9 and conditions provided for in that contract. Either the\\n10 electricity provider or the customer may require compliance\\n11 with the prices, terms, and conditions of the contract.\\n12 (n) At such time, if any, that statewide net metering\\n13 penetration equals 5% the load of the electricity provider\\'s\\n14 net metering customers equals 5% of the total peak demand\\n15 supplied by that electricity provider during the previous\\n16 year, as specified in subsection (j) of this Section, and the\\n17 distributed generation rebate tariff for the electricity\\n18 utility prescribed by subsection (e) of Section 16-107.6 of\\n19 this Act has gone into effect and the rebate is approved and\\n20 available to eligible customers, the net metering services\\n21 described in subsections (d), (d-5), (e), (e-5), and (f) of\\n22 this Section shall no longer be offered, except as to those\\n23 eligible renewable generating facilities for which retail\\n24 customers that are receiving net metering service under these\\n25 subsections at the time the net metering services under those\\n26 subsections are no longer offered; those systems shallHB0804 - 689 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 continue to receive net metering services described in\\n2 subsections (d), (d-5), (e), (e-5), and (f) of this Section\\n3 for the lifetime of the system, regardless of whether those\\n4 retail customers change electricity providers or whether the\\n5 retail customer benefiting from the system changes. Those\\n6 retail customers that begin taking net metering service after\\n7 the date that net metering services are no longer offered\\n8 under such subsections shall be subject to the provisions set\\n9 forth in the following paragraphs (1) through (3) of this\\n10 subsection (n):\\n11 (1) An electricity provider shall charge or credit for\\n12 the net electricity supplied to eligible customers or\\n13 provided by eligible customers whose electric supply\\n14 service is not provided based on hourly pricing in the\\n15 following manner:\\n16 (A) If the amount of electricity used by the\\n17 customer during the billing period exceeds the amount\\n18 of electricity produced by the customer, then the\\n19 electricity provider shall charge the customer for the\\n20 net kilowatt-hour based electricity charges reflected\\n21 in the customer\\'s electric service rate supplied to\\n22 and used by the customer as provided in paragraph (3)\\n23 of this subsection (n).\\n24 (B) If the amount of electricity produced by a\\n25 customer during the billing period exceeds the amount\\n26 of electricity used by the customer during thatHB0804 - 690 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 billing period, then the electricity provider\\n2 supplying that customer shall apply a 1:1\\n3 kilowatt-hour energy credit that reflects the\\n4 kilowatt-hour based energy charges in the customer\\'s\\n5 electric service rate to a subsequent bill for service\\n6 to the customer for the net electricity supplied to\\n7 the electricity provider. The electricity provider\\n8 shall continue to carry over any excess kilowatt-hour\\n9 energy credits earned and apply those credits to\\n10 subsequent billing periods to offset any\\n11 customer-generator consumption in those billing\\n12 periods until all credits are used or until the end of\\n13 the annualized period.\\n14 (C) At the end of the year or annualized over the\\n15 period that service is supplied by means of net\\n16 metering, or in the event that the retail customer\\n17 terminates service with the electricity provider prior\\n18 to the end of the year or the annualized period, any\\n19 remaining credits in the customer\\'s account shall\\n20 expire.\\n21 (2) An electricity provider shall charge or credit for\\n22 the net electricity supplied to eligible customers or\\n23 provided by eligible customers whose electric supply\\n24 service is provided based on hourly pricing in the\\n25 following manner:\\n26 (A) If the amount of electricity used by theHB0804 - 691 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 customer during any hourly period exceeds the amount\\n2 of electricity produced by the customer, then the\\n3 electricity provider shall charge the customer for the\\n4 net electricity supplied to and used by the customer\\n5 as provided in paragraph (3) of this subsection (n).\\n6 (B) If the amount of electricity produced by a\\n7 customer during any hourly period exceeds the amount\\n8 of electricity used by the customer during that hourly\\n9 period, the energy provider shall calculate an energy\\n10 credit for the net kilowatt-hours produced in such\\n11 period. The value of the energy credit shall be\\n12 calculated using the same price per kilowatt-hour as\\n13 the electric service provider would charge for\\n14 kilowatt-hour energy sales during that same hourly\\n15 period.\\n16 (3) An electricity provider shall provide electric\\n17 service to eligible customers who utilize net metering at\\n18 non-discriminatory rates that are identical, with respect\\n19 to rate structure, retail rate components, and any monthly\\n20 charges, to the rates that the customer would be charged\\n21 if not a net metering customer. An electricity provider\\n22 shall charge the customer for the net electricity supplied\\n23 to and used by the customer according to the terms of the\\n24 contract or tariff to which the same customer would be\\n25 assigned or be eligible for if the customer was not a net\\n26 metering customer. An electricity provider shall notHB0804 - 692 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 charge net metering customers any fee or charge or require\\n2 additional equipment, insurance, or any other requirements\\n3 not specifically authorized by interconnection standards\\n4 authorized by the Commission, unless the fee, charge, or\\n5 other requirement would apply to other similarly situated\\n6 customers who are not net metering customers. The charge\\n7 or credit that the customer receives for net electricity\\n8 shall be at a rate equal to the customer\\'s energy supply\\n9 rate. The customer remains responsible for the gross\\n10 amount of delivery services charges, supply-related\\n11 charges that are kilowatt based, and all taxes and fees\\n12 related to such charges. The customer also remains\\n13 responsible for all taxes and fees that would otherwise be\\n14 applicable to the net amount of electricity used by the\\n15 customer. Paragraphs (1) and (2) of this subsection (n)\\n16 shall not be construed to prevent an arms-length agreement\\n17 between an electricity provider and an eligible customer\\n18 that sets forth different prices, terms, and conditions\\n19 for the provision of net metering service, including, but\\n20 not limited to, the provision of the appropriate metering\\n21 equipment for non-residential customers. Nothing in this\\n22 paragraph (3) shall be interpreted to mandate that a\\n23 utility that is only required to provide delivery services\\n24 to a given customer must also sell electricity to such\\n25 customer.\\n26 (o) Within 90 days after the effective date of thisHB0804 - 693 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, each electric\\n2 utility subject to this Section shall file a tariff that\\n3 shall, consistent with the provisions of this Section, propose\\n4 the terms and conditions under which an eligible customer may\\n5 participate in net metering. The Commission shall approve, or\\n6 approve with modification based on a stakeholder process, the\\n7 tariff within 120 days after the effective date of this\\n8 amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly.

Until devices that meet the IEEE\\n25 1547-2018 standard are available, devices that meet the ULHB0804 - 694 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 1741 SA standard are acceptable can autonomously contribute to\\n2 grid support during excursions from normal operating voltage\\n3 and frequency conditions by providing each of the following:\\n4 dynamic reactive and real power support, voltage and frequency\\n5 ride-through, ramp rate controls, communication systems with\\n6 ability to accept external commands, and other functions from\\n7 the electric utility.\\n8 \"Subscriber\" has the meaning set forth in Section 1-10 of\\n9 the Illinois Power Agency Act.\\n10 \"Subscription\" has the meaning set forth in Section 1-10\\n11 of the Illinois Power Agency Act.\\n12 \"Threshold date\" means the date on which statewide net\\n13 metering penetration equals 5% the load of an electricity\\n14 provider\\'s net metering customers equals 5% of the total peak\\n15 demand supplied by that electricity provider during the\\n16 previous year, as specified under subsection (j) of Section\\n17 16-107.5 of this Act.\\n18 (b) An electric utility that serves more than 200,000\\n19 customers in the State shall file a petition with the\\n20 Commission requesting approval of the utility\\'s tariff to\\n21 provide a rebate to a retail customer who owns or operates\\n22 distributed generation that meets the following criteria:\\n23 (1) has a nameplate generating capacity no greater\\n24 than 2,000 kilowatts and is primarily used to offset that\\n25 customer\\'s electricity load;\\n26 (2) is located on the customer\\'s side of the billingHB0804 - 695 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 meter premises, for the customer\\'s own use, and not for\\n2 commercial use or sales, including, but not limited to,\\n3 wholesale sales of electric power and energy;\\n4 (3) is located in the electric utility\\'s service\\n5 territory; and\\n6 (4) is interconnected under rules adopted by the\\n7 Commission by means of the inverter or smart inverter\\n8 required by this Section, as applicable.\\n9 For purposes of this Section, \"distributed generation\"\\n10 shall satisfy the definition of distributed renewable energy\\n11 generation device set forth in Section 1-10 of the Illinois\\n12 Power Agency Act to the extent such definition is consistent\\n13 with the requirements of this Section.\\n14 In addition, any new photovoltaic distributed generation\\n15 that is installed after the effective date of this amendatory\\n16 Act of the 99th General Assembly must be installed by a\\n17 qualified person, as defined by subsection (i) of Section 1-56\\n18 of the Illinois Power Agency Act.\\n19 The tariff shall provide that the smart inverter\\n20 associated with the distributed generation shall provide\\n21 autonomous responses to grid conditions through its default\\n22 settings as approved by the Commission utility shall be\\n23 permitted to operate and control the smart inverter associated\\n24 with the distributed generation that is the subject of the\\n25 rebate for the purpose of preserving reliability during\\n26 distribution system reliability events and shall address theHB0804 - 696 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 terms and conditions of the operation and the compensation\\n2 associated with the operation. Nothing in this Section shall\\n3 negate or supersede Institute of Electrical and Electronics\\n4 Engineers equipment interconnection requirements or standards\\n5 or other similar standards or requirements. The tariff shall\\n6 not limit the ability of the smart inverter or other\\n7 distributed energy resource to provide wholesale market\\n8 products such as regulation, demand response, or other\\n9 services, or limit the ability of the owner of the smart\\n10 inverter or the other distributed energy resource to receive\\n11 compensation for providing those wholesale market products or\\n12 services. The tariff shall also provide for additional uses of\\n13 the smart inverter that shall be separately compensated and\\n14 which may include, but are not limited to, voltage and VAR\\n15 support, regulation, and other grid services. As part of the\\n16 proceeding described in subsection (e) of this Section, the\\n17 Commission shall review and determine whether smart inverters\\n18 can provide any additional uses or services. If the Commission\\n19 determines that an additional use or service would be\\n20 beneficial, the Commission shall determine the terms and\\n21 conditions of the operation and how the use or service should\\n22 be separately compensated.\\n23 (c) The proposed tariff authorized by subsection (b) of\\n24 this Section shall include the following participation terms\\n25 and formulae to calculate the value of the rebates to be\\n26 applied under this Section for distributed generation thatHB0804 - 697 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 satisfies the criteria set forth in subsection (b) of this\\n2 Section:\\n3 (1) Until the utility\\'s tariff or tariffs setting the\\n4 new compensation values established under subsection (e)\\n5 take effect utility files its tariff or tariffs to place\\n6 into effect the rebate values established by the\\n7 Commission under subsection (e) of this Section,\\n8 non-residential customers that are taking service under a\\n9 net metering program offered by an electricity provider\\n10 under the terms of Section 16-107.5 of this Act may apply\\n11 for a rebate as provided for in this Section. The value of\\n12 the rebate shall be $250 per kilowatt of nameplate\\n13 generating capacity, measured as nominal DC power output,\\n14 of a non-residential customer\\'s distributed generation.\\n15 (2) After the utility\\'s tariff or tariffs setting the\\n16 new rebate values established under subsection (e) (d) of\\n17 this Section take effect, retail customers may, as\\n18 applicable, make the following elections:\\n19 (A) Residential customers that are taking service\\n20 under a net metering program offered by an electricity\\n21 provider under the terms of Section 16-107.5 of this\\n22 Act on the threshold date may elect to either continue\\n23 to take such service under the terms of such program as\\n24 in effect on such threshold date for the useful life of\\n25 the customer\\'s eligible renewable electric generating\\n26 facility as defined in such Section, or file anHB0804 - 698 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 application to receive a rebate under the terms of\\n2 this Section, provided that such application must be\\n3 submitted within 6 months after the effective date of\\n4 the tariff approved under subsection (d) of this\\n5 Section. The value of the rebate shall be the amount\\n6 established by the Commission and reflected in the\\n7 utility\\'s tariff approved pursuant to subsection (e)\\n8 of this Section.\\n9 (B) Non-residential customers that are taking\\n10 service under a net metering program offered by an\\n11 electricity provider under the terms of Section\\n12 16-107.5 of this Act on the threshold date may apply\\n13 for a rebate as provided for in this Section. The value\\n14 of the rebate shall be the amount established by the\\n15 Commission and reflected in the utility\\'s tariff\\n16 pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section.\\n17 (3) Upon approval of a rebate application submitted\\n18 under this subsection (c), the retail customer shall no\\n19 longer be entitled to receive any delivery service credits\\n20 for the excess electricity generated by its facility and\\n21 shall be subject to the provisions of subsection (n) of\\n22 Section 16-107.5 of this Act.\\n23 (4) To be eligible for a rebate described in this\\n24 subsection (c), customers who begin taking service after\\n25 the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th\\n26 General Assembly under a net metering program offered byHB0804 - 699 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 an electricity provider under the terms of Section\\n2 16-107.5 of this Act must have a smart inverter associated\\n3 with the customer\\'s distributed generation.\\n4 (d) The Commission shall review the proposed tariff\\n5 submitted under subsections (b) and (c) of this Section and\\n6 may make changes to the tariff that are consistent with this\\n7 Section and with the Commission\\'s authority under Article IX\\n8 of this Act, subject to notice and hearing. Following notice\\n9 and hearing, the Commission shall issue an order approving, or\\n10 approving with modification, such tariff no later than 240\\n11 days after the utility files its tariff.\\n12 (e) When statewide the total generating capacity of the\\n13 electricity provider\\'s net metering penetration, as defined in\\n14 Section 16-107.5, customers is equal to 3%, the Commission\\n15 shall open an investigation into a an annual process and\\n16 formula for calculating the compensation value of rebates for\\n17 the retail customers described in subsections (b) and (f) of\\n18 this Section that submit rebate applications after the\\n19 threshold date for an electric utility that elected to file a\\n20 tariff pursuant to this Section. The investigation shall\\n21 include, at minimum, diverse sets of stakeholders, a review of\\n22 best practices in calculating the value of distributed energy\\n23 resource benefits, and assessments of present and future\\n24 technological capabilities of distributed energy resources.\\n25 Compensation shall reflect all known and measurable values of\\n26 the distributed energy resources over their full expectedHB0804 - 700 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 useful lives. Compensation shall reflect, but shall not be\\n2 limited to, any geographic, time-based, performance-based, and\\n3 other benefits of distributed energy resources, as well as\\n4 technological capabilities and present and future grid needs.\\n5 The Commission\\'s final order concluding this investigation\\n6 shall establish a formula for the compensation of distributed\\n7 energy resources, and an initial set of inputs for that\\n8 formula. The Commission\\'s final order concluding this\\n9 proceeding shall also direct the utilities to update the\\n10 formula, on an annual basis, with inputs derived from their\\n11 integrated grid plans developed pursuant to Section 16-105.17.\\n12 The Commission shall also determine, as a part of its\\n13 investigation under this subsection, whether distributed\\n14 energy resources can provide any additional beneficial uses or\\n15 services through utility-controlled responses to grid\\n16 conditions. If the Commission determines that distributed\\n17 energy resources can provide additional beneficial uses or\\n18 services, the Commission shall determine the terms and\\n19 conditions for the operation and compensation of those uses\\n20 and services. That compensation shall be above and beyond any\\n21 rebate that the distributed energy resource receives. diverse\\n22 sets of stakeholders, calculations for valuing distributed\\n23 energy resource benefits to the grid based on best practices,\\n24 and assessments of present and future technological\\n25 capabilities of distributed energy resources. The value of\\n26 such rebates shall reflect the value of the distributedHB0804 - 701 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 generation to the distribution system at the location at which\\n2 it is interconnected, taking into account the geographic,\\n3 time-based, and performance-based benefits, as well as\\n4 technological capabilities and present and future grid needs.\\n5 The Commission shall consider the electric utility\\'s\\n6 integrated grid plan developed pursuant to Section 16-105.17\\n7 of this Act to help identify the value of distributed energy\\n8 resources for the purpose of calculating the rebates described\\n9 in this subsection. The Commission shall determine additional\\n10 compensation for distributed generation that creates savings\\n11 and value on the distribution system by being co-located or in\\n12 close proximity to electric vehicle charging infrastructure in\\n13 use by medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles, primarily serving\\n14 environmental justice communities, as outlined in the utility\\n15 integrated grid planning process under Section 16-105.17 of\\n16 this Act. No later than 10 days after the Commission enters its\\n17 final order under this subsection (e), each the utility shall\\n18 file its tariff or tariffs in compliance with the order,\\n19 including new tariffs for the recovery of costs incurred under\\n20 this subsection (e) that shall provide for volumetric-based\\n21 cost recovery, and the Commission shall approve, or approve\\n22 with modification, the tariff or tariffs within 240 45 days\\n23 after the utility\\'s filing. For those rebate applications\\n24 filed after the threshold date but before the utility\\'s tariff\\n25 or tariffs filed pursuant to this subsection (e) take effect,\\n26 the value of the rebate shall remain at the value establishedHB0804 - 702 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 in subsection (c) of this Section until the tariff is\\n2 approved. As part of the process, the Commission shall ensure\\n3 that the distributed generation rebate results in stable\\n4 growth of both small and large distributed generation projects\\n5 in Illinois as provided in subsection (j) of Section 16-107.5\\n6 of this Act, with particular attention to impacts to the\\n7 growth of residential distributed generation customers. The\\n8 Commission has the authority to establish interim rebate\\n9 values for part or all of a utility\\'s service territory to\\n10 ensure transparency and stability of compensation for\\n11 distributed energy resources in the utility\\'s service\\n12 territory.\\n13 (f) Notwithstanding any provision of this Act to the\\n14 contrary, the owner, developer, or subscriber of a generation\\n15 facility that is part of a net metering program provided under\\n16 subsection (l) of Section 16-107.5 shall also be eligible to\\n17 apply for the rebate described in this Section. A subscriber\\n18 to the generation facility may apply for a rebate in the amount\\n19 of the subscriber\\'s subscription only if the owner, developer,\\n20 or previous subscriber to the same panel or panels has not\\n21 already submitted an application, and, regardless of whether\\n22 the subscriber is a residential or non-residential customer,\\n23 may be allowed the amount identified in paragraph (1) of\\n24 subsection (c) or in subsection (e) of this Section applicable\\n25 to such customer on the date that the application is\\n26 submitted. An application for a rebate for a portion of aHB0804 - 703 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 project described in this subsection (f) may be submitted at\\n2 or after the time that a related request for net metering is\\n3 made.\\n4 (g) No later than 60 days after the utility receives an\\n5 application for a rebate under its tariff approved under\\n6 subsection (d) or (e) of this Section, the utility shall issue\\n7 a rebate to the applicant under the terms of the tariff. In the\\n8 event the application is incomplete or the utility is\\n9 otherwise unable to calculate the payment based on the\\n10 information provided by the owner, the utility shall issue the\\n11 payment no later than 60 days after the application is\\n12 complete or all requested information is received.\\n13 (h) An electric utility shall recover from its retail\\n14 customers all of the costs of the rebates made under a tariff\\n15 or tariffs approved under subsection (d) of placed into effect\\n16 under this Section, including, but not limited to, the value\\n17 of the rebates and all costs incurred by the utility to comply\\n18 with and implement subsections (b) and (c) of this Section,\\n19 but not including costs incurred by the utility to comply with\\n20 and implement subsection (e) of this Section, consistent with\\n21 the following provisions:\\n22 (1) The utility shall defer the full amount of its\\n23 costs incurred under this Section as a regulatory asset.\\n24 The total costs deferred as a regulatory asset shall be\\n25 amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized balance\\n26 shall be recognized as of December 31 for a given year. TheHB0804 - 704 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 utility shall also earn a return on the total of the\\n2 unamortized balance of the regulatory assets, less any\\n3 deferred taxes related to the unamortized balance, at an\\n4 annual rate equal to the utility\\'s weighted average cost\\n5 of capital that includes, based on a year-end capital\\n6 structure, the utility\\'s actual cost of debt for the\\n7 applicable calendar year and a cost of equity, which shall\\n8 be calculated as the sum of (i) the average for the\\n9 applicable calendar year of the monthly average yields of\\n10 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by the Board of\\n11 Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15\\n12 Statistical Release or successor publication; and (ii) 580\\n13 basis points, including a revenue conversion factor\\n14 calculated to recover or refund all additional income\\n15 taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that\\n16 return.\\n17 When an electric utility creates a regulatory asset\\n18 under the provisions of this Section, the costs are\\n19 recovered over a period during which customers also\\n20 receive a benefit, which is in the public interest.\\n21 Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that\\n22 an electric utility that elects to create a regulatory\\n23 asset under the provisions of this Section shall recover\\n24 all of the associated costs, including, but not limited\\n25 to, its cost of capital as set forth in this Section. After\\n26 the Commission has approved the prudence andHB0804 - 705 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 reasonableness of the costs that comprise the regulatory\\n2 asset, the electric utility shall be permitted to recover\\n3 all such costs, and the value and recoverability through\\n4 rates of the associated regulatory asset shall not be\\n5 limited, altered, impaired, or reduced. To enable the\\n6 financing of the incremental capital expenditures,\\n7 including regulatory assets, for electric utilities that\\n8 serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than\\n9 500,000 retail customers in the State, the utility\\'s\\n10 actual year-end capital structure that includes a common\\n11 equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of up to and including\\n12 50% of the total capital structure shall be deemed\\n13 reasonable and used to set rates.\\n14 (2) The utility, at its election, may recover all of\\n15 the costs it incurs under this Section as part of a filing\\n16 for a general increase in rates under Article IX of this\\n17 Act, as part of an annual filing to update a\\n18 performance-based formula rate under subsection (d) of\\n19 Section 16-108.5 of this Act, or through an automatic\\n20 adjustment clause tariff, provided that nothing in this\\n21 paragraph (2) permits the double recovery of such costs\\n22 from customers. If the utility elects to recover the costs\\n23 it incurs under this Section through an automatic\\n24 adjustment clause tariff, the utility may file its\\n25 proposed tariff together with the tariff it files under\\n26 subsection (b) of this Section or at a later time. TheHB0804 - 706 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 proposed tariff shall provide for an annual\\n2 reconciliation, less any deferred taxes related to the\\n3 reconciliation, with interest at an annual rate of return\\n4 equal to the utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital as\\n5 calculated under paragraph (1) of this subsection (h),\\n6 including a revenue conversion factor calculated to\\n7 recover or refund all additional income taxes that may be\\n8 payable or receivable as a result of that return, of the\\n9 revenue requirement reflected in rates for each calendar\\n10 year, beginning with the calendar year in which the\\n11 utility files its automatic adjustment clause tariff under\\n12 this subsection (h), with what the revenue requirement\\n13 would have been had the actual cost information for the\\n14 applicable calendar year been available at the filing\\n15 date. The Commission shall review the proposed tariff and\\n16 may make changes to the tariff that are consistent with\\n17 this Section and with the Commission\\'s authority under\\n18 Article IX of this Act, subject to notice and hearing.\\n19 Following notice and hearing, the Commission shall issue\\n20 an order approving, or approving with modification, such\\n21 tariff no later than 240 days after the utility files its\\n22 tariff.\\n23 (i) An electric utility shall recover from its retail\\n24 customers, on a volumetric basis, all of the costs of the\\n25 rebates made under a tariff or tariffs placed into effect\\n26 under subsection (e) of this Section, including, but notHB0804 - 707 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 limited to, the value of the rebates and all costs incurred by\\n2 the utility to comply with and implement subsection (e) of\\n3 this Section, consistent with the following provisions:\\n4 (1) The utility may defer a portion of its costs as a\\n5 regulatory asset. The Commission shall determine the\\n6 portion that may be appropriately deferred as a regulatory\\n7 asset. Factors that the Commission shall consider in\\n8 determining the portion of costs that shall be deferred as\\n9 a regulatory asset include, but are not limited to: (i)\\n10 whether and the extent to which a cost effectively\\n11 deferred or avoided other distribution system costs; (ii)\\n12 the extent to which a cost provides environmental\\n13 benefits; (iii) the extent to which a cost improves system\\n14 reliability or resilience; (iv) the electric utility\\'s\\n15 distribution system plan developed pursuant to Section\\n16 16-108.17 of this Act; and (v) such other factors as the\\n17 Commission deems appropriate. The remainder of costs shall\\n18 be deemed an operating expense and shall be recoverable if\\n19 found prudent and reasonable by the Commission.\\n20 The total costs deferred as a regulatory asset shall\\n21 be amortized over a 15-year period. The unamortized\\n22 balance shall be recognized as of December 31 for a given\\n23 year. The utility shall also earn a return on the total of\\n24 the unamortized balance of the regulatory assets, less any\\n25 deferred taxes related to the unamortized balance, at an\\n26 annual rate equal to the utility\\'s weighted average costHB0804 - 708 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 of capital that includes, based on a year-end capital\\n2 structure, the utility\\'s actual cost of debt for the\\n3 applicable calendar year and a cost of equity, which shall\\n4 be calculated as the sum of: (I) the average for the\\n5 applicable calendar year of the monthly average yields of\\n6 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by the Board of\\n7 Governors of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15\\n8 Statistical Release or successor publication; and (II) 580\\n9 basis points, including a revenue conversion factor\\n10 calculated to recover or refund all additional income\\n11 taxes that may be payable or receivable as a result of that\\n12 return.\\n13 When an electric utility creates a regulatory asset\\n14 under the provisions of this subsection (i), the costs are\\n15 recovered over a period during which customers also\\n16 receive a benefit, which is in the public interest.\\n17 Accordingly, it is the intent of the General Assembly that\\n18 an electric utility that elects to create a regulatory\\n19 asset under the provisions of this Section shall recover\\n20 all of the associated costs, including, but not limited\\n21 to, its cost of capital as set forth in this Section. After\\n22 the Commission has approved the prudence and\\n23 reasonableness of the costs that comprise the regulatory\\n24 asset, the electric utility shall be permitted to recover\\n25 all such costs, and the value and recoverability through\\n26 rates of the associated regulatory asset shall not beHB0804 - 709 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 limited, altered, impaired, or reduced. To enable the\\n2 financing of the incremental capital expenditures,\\n3 including regulatory assets, for electric utilities that\\n4 serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers but more than\\n5 500,000 retail customers in the State, the utility\\'s\\n6 actual year-end capital structure that includes a common\\n7 equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of up to and including\\n8 50% of the total capital structure shall be deemed\\n9 reasonable and used to set rates.\\n10 (2) The utility may recover all of the costs through\\n11 an automatic adjustment clause tariff, on a volumetric\\n12 basis. The utility may file its proposed cost-recovery\\n13 tariff together with the tariff it files under subsection\\n14 (e) of this Section or at a later time. The proposed tariff\\n15 shall provide for an annual reconciliation, less any\\n16 deferred taxes related to the reconciliation, with\\n17 interest at an annual rate of return equal to the\\n18 utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital as calculated\\n19 under paragraph (1) of this subsection (i), including a\\n20 revenue conversion factor calculated to recover or refund\\n21 all additional income taxes that may be payable or\\n22 receivable as a result of that return, of the revenue\\n23 requirement reflected in rates for each calendar year,\\n24 beginning with the calendar year in which the utility\\n25 files its automatic adjustment clause tariff under this\\n26 subsection (i), with what the revenue requirement wouldHB0804 - 710 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 have been had the actual cost information for the\\n2 applicable calendar year been available at the filing\\n3 date. The Commission shall review the proposed tariff and\\n4 may make changes to the tariff that are consistent with\\n5 this Section and with the Commission\\'s authority under\\n6 Article IX of this Act, subject to notice and hearing.\\n7 Following notice and hearing, the Commission shall issue\\n8 an order approving, or approving with modification, such\\n9 tariff no later than 240 days after the utility files its\\n10 tariff.\\n11 (j) (i) No later than 90 days after the Commission enters\\n12 an order, or order on rehearing, whichever is later, approving\\n13 an electric utility\\'s proposed tariff under subsection (d) of\\n14 this Section, the electric utility shall provide notice of the\\n15 availability of rebates under this Section. Subsequent to the\\n16 utility\\'s notice, any entity that offers in the State, for\\n17 sale or lease, distributed generation and estimates the dollar\\n18 saving attributable to such distributed generation shall\\n19 provide estimates based on both delivery service credits, if\\n20 applicable and if available under Section 16-107.5 of this\\n21 Act, and the rebates available under this Section.\\n22 (Source: P.A. 99-906, eff. 6-1-17.)\\n23 (220 ILCS 5/16-107.7 new)\\n24 Sec. 16-107.7. Residential time-of-use pricing.\\n25 (a) The General Assembly finds that time-of-use rates andHB0804 - 711 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 pricing plans can lower energy costs for consumers and reduce\\n2 grid costs as well as help Illinois achieve its energy policy\\n3 goals by improving load shape, encouraging energy\\n4 conservation, and shifting usage away from periods where\\n5 fossil fuels are used to meet peak demand. Further, by\\n6 providing consumers information relating the costs of service\\n7 to the time of energy usage, time-of-use rates can help\\n8 consumers reduce their energy bills by using electricity when\\n9 it is less costly. Time-of-use rates can help allocate\\n10 electricity system costs more accurately and thus equitably to\\n11 those who cause costs. Such rates can reduce the need for\\n12 ramping resources and increase the grid\\'s ability to\\n13 cost-effectively integrate greater quantities of variable\\n14 renewable energy and distributed energy resources.\\n15 (b) An electric utility that has a tariff in effect under\\n16 Section 16-108.5 as of the effective date of this amendatory\\n17 Act of the 102nd General Assembly shall also offer at least one\\n18 market-based, time-of-use rate for eligible retail customers\\n19 that choose to take power and energy supply service from the\\n20 utility.

An electric utility shall provide the components\\n24 of delivery services that are subject to the jurisdiction of\\n25 the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission at the same prices,HB0804 - 733 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 terms and conditions set forth in its applicable tariff as\\n2 approved or allowed into effect by that Commission. The\\n3 Commission shall otherwise have the authority pursuant to\\n4 Article IX to review, approve, and modify the prices, terms\\n5 and conditions of those components of delivery services not\\n6 subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory\\n7 Commission, including the authority to determine the extent to\\n8 which such delivery services should be offered on an unbundled\\n9 basis. In making any such determination the Commission shall\\n10 consider, at a minimum, the effect of additional unbundling on\\n11 (i) the objective of just and reasonable rates, (ii) electric\\n12 utility employees, and (iii) the development of competitive\\n13 markets for electric energy services in Illinois.\\n14 (b) The Commission shall enter an order approving, or\\n15 approving as modified, the delivery services tariff no later\\n16 than 30 days prior to the date on which the electric utility\\n17 must commence offering such services. The Commission may\\n18 subsequently modify such tariff pursuant to this Act.\\n19 (c) The electric utility\\'s tariffs shall define the\\n20 classes of its customers for purposes of delivery services\\n21 charges. Delivery services shall be priced and made available\\n22 to all retail customers electing delivery services in each\\n23 such class on a nondiscriminatory basis regardless of whether\\n24 the retail customer chooses the electric utility, an affiliate\\n25 of the electric utility, or another entity as its supplier of\\n26 electric power and energy. Charges for delivery services shallHB0804 - 734 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 be cost based, and shall allow the electric utility to recover\\n2 the costs of providing delivery services through its charges\\n3 to its delivery service customers that use the facilities and\\n4 services associated with such costs. Such costs shall include\\n5 the costs of owning, operating and maintaining transmission\\n6 and distribution facilities. The Commission shall also be\\n7 authorized to consider whether, and if so to what extent, the\\n8 following costs are appropriately included in the electric\\n9 utility\\'s delivery services rates: (i) the costs of that\\n10 portion of generation facilities used for the production and\\n11 absorption of reactive power in order that retail customers\\n12 located in the electric utility\\'s service area can receive\\n13 electric power and energy from suppliers other than the\\n14 electric utility, and (ii) the costs associated with the use\\n15 and redispatch of generation facilities to mitigate\\n16 constraints on the transmission or distribution system in\\n17 order that retail customers located in the electric utility\\'s\\n18 service area can receive electric power and energy from\\n19 suppliers other than the electric utility. Nothing in this\\n20 subsection shall be construed as directing the Commission to\\n21 allocate any of the costs described in (i) or (ii) that are\\n22 found to be appropriately included in the electric utility\\'s\\n23 delivery services rates to any particular customer group or\\n24 geographic area in setting delivery services rates.\\n25 (d) The Commission shall establish charges, terms and\\n26 conditions for delivery services that are just and reasonableHB0804 - 735 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 and shall take into account customer impacts when establishing\\n2 such charges. In establishing charges, terms and conditions\\n3 for delivery services, the Commission shall take into account\\n4 voltage level differences. A retail customer shall have the\\n5 option to request to purchase electric service at any delivery\\n6 service voltage reasonably and technically feasible from the\\n7 electric facilities serving that customer\\'s premises provided\\n8 that there are no significant adverse impacts upon system\\n9 reliability or system efficiency. A retail customer shall also\\n10 have the option to request to purchase electric service at any\\n11 point of delivery that is reasonably and technically feasible\\n12 provided that there are no significant adverse impacts on\\n13 system reliability or efficiency. Such requests shall not be\\n14 unreasonably denied.\\n15 (e) Electric utilities shall recover the costs of\\n16 installing, operating or maintaining facilities for the\\n17 particular benefit of one or more delivery services customers,\\n18 including without limitation any costs incurred in complying\\n19 with a customer\\'s request to be served at a different voltage\\n20 level, directly from the retail customer or customers for\\n21 whose benefit the costs were incurred, to the extent such\\n22 costs are not recovered through the charges referred to in\\n23 subsections (c) and (d) of this Section.\\n24 (f) An electric utility shall be entitled but not required\\n25 to implement transition charges in conjunction with the\\n26 offering of delivery services pursuant to Section 16-104. IfHB0804 - 736 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 an electric utility implements transition charges, it shall\\n2 implement such charges for all delivery services customers and\\n3 for all customers described in subsection (h), but shall not\\n4 implement transition charges for power and energy that a\\n5 retail customer takes from cogeneration or self-generation\\n6 facilities located on that retail customer\\'s premises, if such\\n7 facilities meet the following criteria:\\n8 (i) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities\\n9 serve a single retail customer and are located on that\\n10 retail customer\\'s premises (for purposes of this\\n11 subparagraph and subparagraph (ii), an industrial or\\n12 manufacturing retail customer and a third party contractor\\n13 that is served by such industrial or manufacturing\\n14 customer through such retail customer\\'s own electrical\\n15 distribution facilities under the circumstances described\\n16 in subsection (vi) of the definition of \"alternative\\n17 retail electric supplier\" set forth in Section 16-102,\\n18 shall be considered a single retail customer);\\n19 (ii) the cogeneration or self-generation facilities\\n20 either (A) are sized pursuant to generally accepted\\n21 engineering standards for the retail customer\\'s electrical\\n22 load at that premises (taking into account standby or\\n23 other reliability considerations related to that retail\\n24 customer\\'s operations at that site) or (B) if the facility\\n25 is a cogeneration facility located on the retail\\n26 customer\\'s premises, the retail customer is the thermalHB0804 - 737 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 host for that facility and the facility has been designed\\n2 to meet that retail customer\\'s thermal energy requirements\\n3 resulting in electrical output beyond that retail\\n4 customer\\'s electrical demand at that premises, comply with\\n5 the operating and efficiency standards applicable to\\n6 \"qualifying facilities\" specified in title 18 Code of\\n7 Federal Regulations Section 292.205 as in effect on the\\n8 effective date of this amendatory Act of 1999;\\n9 (iii) the retail customer on whose premises the\\n10 facilities are located either has an exclusive right to\\n11 receive, and corresponding obligation to pay for, all of\\n12 the electrical capacity of the facility, or in the case of\\n13 a cogeneration facility that has been designed to meet the\\n14 retail customer\\'s thermal energy requirements at that\\n15 premises, an identified amount of the electrical capacity\\n16 of the facility, over a minimum 5-year period; and\\n17 (iv) if the cogeneration facility is sized for the\\n18 retail customer\\'s thermal load at that premises but\\n19 exceeds the electrical load, any sales of excess power or\\n20 energy are made only at wholesale, are subject to the\\n21 jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission,\\n22 and are not for the purpose of circumventing the\\n23 provisions of this subsection (f).\\n24 If a generation facility located at a retail customer\\'s\\n25 premises does not meet the above criteria, an electric utility\\n26 implementing transition charges shall implement a transitionHB0804 - 738 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 charge until December 31, 2006 for any power and energy taken\\n2 by such retail customer from such facility as if such power and\\n3 energy had been delivered by the electric utility. Provided,\\n4 however, that an industrial retail customer that is taking\\n5 power from a generation facility that does not meet the above\\n6 criteria but that is located on such customer\\'s premises will\\n7 not be subject to a transition charge for the power and energy\\n8 taken by such retail customer from such generation facility if\\n9 the facility does not serve any other retail customer and\\n10 either was installed on behalf of the customer and for its own\\n11 use prior to January 1, 1997, or is both predominantly fueled\\n12 by byproducts of such customer\\'s manufacturing process at such\\n13 premises and sells or offers an average of 300 megawatts or\\n14 more of electricity produced from such generation facility\\n15 into the wholesale market. Such charges shall be calculated as\\n16 provided in Section 16-102, and shall be collected on each\\n17 kilowatt-hour delivered under a delivery services tariff to a\\n18 retail customer from the date the customer first takes\\n19 delivery services until December 31, 2006 except as provided\\n20 in subsection (h) of this Section. Provided, however, that an\\n21 electric utility, other than an electric utility providing\\n22 service to at least 1,000,000 customers in this State on\\n23 January 1, 1999, shall be entitled to petition for entry of an\\n24 order by the Commission authorizing the electric utility to\\n25 implement transition charges for an additional period ending\\n26 no later than December 31, 2008. The electric utility shallHB0804 - 739 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 file its petition with supporting evidence no earlier than 16\\n2 months, and no later than 12 months, prior to December 31,\\n3 2006. The Commission shall hold a hearing on the electric\\n4 utility\\'s petition and shall enter its order no later than 8\\n5 months after the petition is filed. The Commission shall\\n6 determine whether and to what extent the electric utility\\n7 shall be authorized to implement transition charges for an\\n8 additional period. The Commission may authorize the electric\\n9 utility to implement transition charges for some or all of the\\n10 additional period, and shall determine the mitigation factors\\n11 to be used in implementing such transition charges; provided,\\n12 that the Commission shall not authorize mitigation factors\\n13 less than 110% of those in effect during the 12 months ended\\n14 December 31, 2006. In making its determination, the Commission\\n15 shall consider the following factors: the necessity to\\n16 implement transition charges for an additional period in order\\n17 to maintain the financial integrity of the electric utility;\\n18 the prudence of the electric utility\\'s actions in reducing its\\n19 costs since the effective date of this amendatory Act of 1997;\\n20 the ability of the electric utility to provide safe, adequate\\n21 and reliable service to retail customers in its service area;\\n22 and the impact on competition of allowing the electric utility\\n23 to implement transition charges for the additional period.\\n24 (g) The electric utility shall file tariffs that establish\\n25 the transition charges to be paid by each class of customers to\\n26 the electric utility in conjunction with the provision ofHB0804 - 740 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 delivery services. The electric utility\\'s tariffs shall define\\n2 the classes of its customers for purposes of calculating\\n3 transition charges. The electric utility\\'s tariffs shall\\n4 provide for the calculation of transition charges on a\\n5 customer-specific basis for any retail customer whose average\\n6 monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric utility\\'s\\n7 system during the 6 months with the customer\\'s highest monthly\\n8 maximum electrical demands equals or exceeds 3.0 megawatts for\\n9 electric utilities having more than 1,000,000 customers, and\\n10 for other electric utilities for any customer that has an\\n11 average monthly maximum electrical demand on the electric\\n12 utility\\'s system of one megawatt or more, and (A) for which\\n13 there exists data on the customer\\'s usage during the 3 years\\n14 preceding the date that the customer became eligible to take\\n15 delivery services, or (B) for which there does not exist data\\n16 on the customer\\'s usage during the 3 years preceding the date\\n17 that the customer became eligible to take delivery services,\\n18 if in the electric utility\\'s reasonable judgment there exists\\n19 comparable usage information or a sufficient basis to develop\\n20 such information, and further provided that the electric\\n21 utility can require customers for which an individual\\n22 calculation is made to sign contracts that set forth the\\n23 transition charges to be paid by the customer to the electric\\n24 utility pursuant to the tariff.\\n25 (h) An electric utility shall also be entitled to file\\n26 tariffs that allow it to collect transition charges fromHB0804 - 741 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 retail customers in the electric utility\\'s service area that\\n2 do not take delivery services but that take electric power or\\n3 energy from an alternative retail electric supplier or from an\\n4 electric utility other than the electric utility in whose\\n5 service area the customer is located. Such charges shall be\\n6 calculated, in accordance with the definition of transition\\n7 charges in Section 16-102, for the period of time that the\\n8 customer would be obligated to pay transition charges if it\\n9 were taking delivery services, except that no deduction for\\n10 delivery services revenues shall be made in such calculation,\\n11 and usage data from the customer\\'s class shall be used where\\n12 historical usage data is not available for the individual\\n13 customer. The customer shall be obligated to pay such charges\\n14 on a lump sum basis on or before the date on which the customer\\n15 commences to take service from the alternative retail electric\\n16 supplier or other electric utility, provided, that the\\n17 electric utility in whose service area the customer is located\\n18 shall offer the customer the option of signing a contract\\n19 pursuant to which the customer pays such charges ratably over\\n20 the period in which the charges would otherwise have applied.\\n21 (i) An electric utility shall be entitled to add to the\\n22 bills of delivery services customers charges pursuant to\\n23 Sections 9-221, 9-222 (except as provided in Section 9-222.1),\\n24 and Section 16-114 of this Act, Section 5-5 of the Electricity\\n25 Infrastructure Maintenance Fee Law, Section 6-5 of the\\n26 Renewable Energy, Energy Efficiency, and Coal ResourcesHB0804 - 742 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Development Law of 1997, and Section 13 of the Energy\\n2 Assistance Act.\\n3 (j) If a retail customer that obtains electric power and\\n4 energy from cogeneration or self-generation facilities\\n5 installed for its own use on or before January 1, 1997,\\n6 subsequently takes service from an alternative retail electric\\n7 supplier or an electric utility other than the electric\\n8 utility in whose service area the customer is located for any\\n9 portion of the customer\\'s electric power and energy\\n10 requirements formerly obtained from those facilities\\n11 (including that amount purchased from the utility in lieu of\\n12 such generation and not as standby power purchases, under a\\n13 cogeneration displacement tariff in effect as of the effective\\n14 date of this amendatory Act of 1997), the transition charges\\n15 otherwise applicable pursuant to subsections (f), (g), or (h)\\n16 of this Section shall not be applicable in any year to that\\n17 portion of the customer\\'s electric power and energy\\n18 requirements formerly obtained from those facilities,\\n19 provided, that for purposes of this subsection (j), such\\n20 portion shall not exceed the average number of kilowatt-hours\\n21 per year obtained from the cogeneration or self-generation\\n22 facilities during the 3 years prior to the date on which the\\n23 customer became eligible for delivery services, except as\\n24 provided in subsection (f) of Section 16-110.\\n25 (k) The electric utility shall be entitled to recover\\n26 through tariffed charges all of the costs associated with theHB0804 - 743 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 purchase of zero emission credits from zero emission\\n2 facilities to meet the requirements of subsection (d-5) of\\n3 Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. Such costs\\n4 shall include the costs of procuring the zero emission\\n5 credits, as well as the reasonable costs that the utility\\n6 incurs as part of the procurement processes and to implement\\n7 and comply with plans and processes approved by the Commission\\n8 under such subsection (d-5). The costs shall be allocated\\n9 across all retail customers through a single, uniform cents\\n10 per kilowatt-hour charge applicable to all retail customers,\\n11 which shall appear as a separate line item on each customer\\'s\\n12 bill. Beginning June 1, 2017, the electric utility shall be\\n13 entitled to recover through tariffed charges all of the costs\\n14 associated with the purchase of renewable energy resources to\\n15 meet the long-term goals and targets of the renewable energy\\n16 resource standards of subsection (c) of Section 1-75 of the\\n17 Illinois Power Agency Act, under procurement plans as approved\\n18 in accordance with that Section and Section 16-111.5 of this\\n19 Act. Such costs shall include the costs of procuring the\\n20 renewable energy resources, as well as the reasonable costs\\n21 that the utility incurs as part of the procurement processes\\n22 and to implement and comply with plans and processes approved\\n23 by the Commission under such Sections. The costs associated\\n24 with the purchase of renewable energy resources shall be\\n25 allocated across all retail customers in proportion to the\\n26 amount of renewable energy resources the utility procures forHB0804 - 744 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 such customers through a single, uniform cents per\\n2 kilowatt-hour charge applicable to such retail customers,\\n3 which shall appear as a separate line item on each such\\n4 customer\\'s bill.\\n5 Notwithstanding whether the Commission has approved the\\n6 initial long-term renewable resources procurement plan as of\\n7 June 1, 2017, an electric utility shall place new tariffed\\n8 charges into effect beginning with the June 2017 monthly\\n9 billing period, to the extent practicable, to begin recovering\\n10 the costs of procuring renewable energy resources, as those\\n11 charges are calculated under the limitations described in\\n12 subparagraph (E) of paragraph (1) of subsection (c) of Section\\n13 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act. Notwithstanding the\\n14 date on which the utility places such new tariffed charges\\n15 into effect, the utility shall be permitted to collect the\\n16 charges under such tariff as if the tariff had been in effect\\n17 beginning with the first day of the June 2017 monthly billing\\n18 period. Money collected from customers for the procurement of\\n19 renewable energy resources in a given delivery may be spent by\\n20 the utility for the procurement of renewable resources over\\n21 any of the following 5 delivery years, after which money shall\\n22 be credited back to retail customers, provided that up to\\n23 $170,000,000 of funds collected, but not used, in a given\\n24 delivery year are first made available to the Illinois Solar\\n25 for All Program established under subsection (b) of Section\\n26 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act to cover budgetHB0804 - 745 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 shortfalls due to unexpected fluctuations in the amount of\\n2 money available to that Program from the Illinois Power Agency\\n3 Renewable Energy Resources Fund. The electric utility shall\\n4 spend all money collected in earlier delivery years that has\\n5 not yet been returned to customers, first, before spending\\n6 money collected in later delivery years. The For the delivery\\n7 years commencing June 1, 2017, June 1, 2018, and June 1, 2019,\\n8 the electric utility shall deposit into a separate interest\\n9 bearing account of a financial institution the monies\\n10 collected under the tariffed charges. Any interest earned\\n11 shall be credited back to retail customers under the\\n12 reconciliation proceeding provided for in this subsection (k),\\n13 provided that the electric utility shall first be reimbursed\\n14 from the interest for the administrative costs that it incurs\\n15 to administer and manage the account. Any taxes due on the\\n16 funds in the account, or interest earned on it, will be paid\\n17 from the account or, if insufficient monies are available in\\n18 the account, from the monies collected under the tariffed\\n19 charges to recover the costs of procuring renewable energy\\n20 resources. Monies deposited in the account shall be subject to\\n21 the review, reconciliation, and true-up process described in\\n22 this subsection (k) that is applicable to the funds collected\\n23 and costs incurred for the procurement of renewable energy\\n24 resources.\\n25 The electric utility shall be entitled to recover all of\\n26 the costs identified in this subsection (k) through automaticHB0804 - 746 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 adjustment clause tariffs applicable to all of the utility\\'s\\n2 retail customers that allow the electric utility to adjust its\\n3 tariffed charges consistent with this subsection (k). The\\n4 determination as to whether any excess funds were collected\\n5 during a given delivery year for the purchase of renewable\\n6 energy resources, and the crediting of any excess funds back\\n7 to retail customers, shall not be made until after the close of\\n8 the delivery year, which will ensure that the maximum amount\\n9 of funds is available to implement the approved long-term\\n10 renewable resources procurement plan during a given delivery\\n11 year. The electric utility\\'s collections under such automatic\\n12 adjustment clause tariffs to recover the costs of renewable\\n13 energy resources and zero emission credits from zero emission\\n14 facilities shall be subject to separate annual review,\\n15 reconciliation, and true-up against actual costs by the\\n16 Commission under a procedure that shall be specified in the\\n17 electric utility\\'s automatic adjustment clause tariffs and\\n18 that shall be approved by the Commission in connection with\\n19 its approval of such tariffs. The procedure shall provide that\\n20 any difference between the electric utility\\'s collections for\\n21 zero emission credits under the automatic adjustment charges\\n22 for an annual period and the electric utility\\'s actual costs\\n23 of renewable energy resources and zero emission credits from\\n24 zero emission facilities for that same annual period shall be\\n25 refunded to or collected from, as applicable, the electric\\n26 utility\\'s retail customers in subsequent periods.HB0804 - 747 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Nothing in this subsection (k) is intended to affect,\\n2 limit, or change the right of the electric utility to recover\\n3 the costs associated with the procurement of renewable energy\\n4 resources for periods commencing before, on, or after June 1,\\n5 2017, as otherwise provided in the Illinois Power Agency Act.\\n6 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Commission\\n7 shall not conduct an annual review, reconciliation, and\\n8 true-up associated with renewable energy resources\\'\\n9 collections and costs for the delivery years commencing June\\n10 1, 2017, June 1, 2018, June 1, 2019, and June 1, 2020, and\\n11 shall instead conduct a single review, reconciliation, and\\n12 true-up associated with renewable energy resources\\'\\n13 collections and costs for the 4-year period beginning June 1,\\n14 2017 and ending May 31, 2021, provided that the review,\\n15 reconciliation, and true-up shall not be initiated until after\\n16 August 31, 2021. During the 4-year period, the utility shall\\n17 be permitted to collect and retain funds under this subsection\\n18 (k) and to purchase renewable energy resources under an\\n19 approved long-term renewable resources procurement plan using\\n20 those funds regardless of the delivery year in which the funds\\n21 were collected during the 4-year period.\\n22 If the amount of funds collected during the delivery year\\n23 commencing June 1, 2017, exceeds the costs incurred during\\n24 that delivery year, then up to half of this excess amount, as\\n25 calculated on June 1, 2018, may be used to fund the programs\\n26 under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois PowerHB0804 - 748 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Agency Act in the same proportion the programs are funded\\n2 under that subsection (b). However, any amount identified\\n3 under this subsection (k) to fund programs under subsection\\n4 (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be\\n5 reduced if it exceeds the funding shortfall. For purposes of\\n6 this Section, \"funding shortfall\" means the difference between\\n7 $200,000,000 and the amount appropriated by the General\\n8 Assembly to the Illinois Power Agency Renewable Energy\\n9 Resources Fund during the period that commences on the\\n10 effective date of this amendatory act of the 99th General\\n11 Assembly and ends on August 1, 2018.\\n12 If the amount of funds collected during the delivery year\\n13 commencing June 1, 2018, exceeds the costs incurred during\\n14 that delivery year, then up to half of this excess amount, as\\n15 calculated on June 1, 2019, may be used to fund the programs\\n16 under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power\\n17 Agency Act in the same proportion the programs are funded\\n18 under that subsection (b). However, any amount identified\\n19 under this subsection (k) to fund programs under subsection\\n20 (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois Power Agency Act shall be\\n21 reduced if it exceeds the funding shortfall.\\n22 If the amount of funds collected during the delivery year\\n23 commencing June 1, 2019, exceeds the costs incurred during\\n24 that delivery year, then up to half of this excess amount, as\\n25 calculated on June 1, 2020, may be used to fund the programs\\n26 under subsection (b) of Section 1-56 of the Illinois PowerHB0804 - 749 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Agency Act in the same proportion the programs are funded\\n2 under that subsection (b).

The Commission shall initiate\\n24 and conduct an investigation of the tariff in a manner\\n25 consistent with the provisions of this subsection (c) and the\\n26 provisions of Article IX of this Act to the extent they do notHB0804 - 769 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 conflict with this subsection (c). Except in the case where\\n2 the Commission finds, after notice and hearing, that a\\n3 participating utility is not satisfying its investment amount\\n4 commitments under subsection (b) of this Section, the\\n5 performance-based formula rate shall remain in effect at the\\n6 discretion of the utility. The performance-based formula rate\\n7 approved by the Commission shall do the following:\\n8 (1) Provide for the recovery of the utility\\'s actual\\n9 costs of delivery services that are prudently incurred and\\n10 reasonable in amount consistent with Commission practice\\n11 and law. The sole fact that a cost differs from that\\n12 incurred in a prior calendar year or that an investment is\\n13 different from that made in a prior calendar year shall\\n14 not imply the imprudence or unreasonableness of that cost\\n15 or investment.\\n16 (2) Reflect the utility\\'s actual year-end capital\\n17 structure for the applicable calendar year, excluding\\n18 goodwill, subject to a determination of prudence and\\n19 reasonableness consistent with Commission practice and\\n20 law. To enable the financing of the incremental capital\\n21 expenditures, including regulatory assets, for electric\\n22 utilities that serve less than 3,000,000 retail customers\\n23 but more than 500,000 retail customers in the State, a\\n24 participating electric utility\\'s actual year-end capital\\n25 structure that includes a common equity ratio, excluding\\n26 goodwill, of up to and including 50% of the total capitalHB0804 - 770 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 structure shall be deemed reasonable and used to set\\n2 rates.\\n3 (3) Include a cost of equity, which shall be\\n4 calculated as the sum of the following:\\n5 (A) the average for the applicable calendar year\\n6 of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury\\n7 bonds published by the Board of Governors of the\\n8 Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15 Statistical\\n9 Release or successor publication; and\\n10 (B) 580 basis points.\\n11 At such time as the Board of Governors of the Federal\\n12 Reserve System ceases to include the monthly average\\n13 yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds in its weekly H.15\\n14 Statistical Release or successor publication, the monthly\\n15 average yields of the U.S. Treasury bonds then having the\\n16 longest duration published by the Board of Governors in\\n17 its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor\\n18 publication shall instead be used for purposes of this\\n19 paragraph (3).\\n20 (4) Permit and set forth protocols, subject to a\\n21 determination of prudence and reasonableness consistent\\n22 with Commission practice and law, for the following:\\n23 (A) recovery of incentive compensation expense\\n24 that is based on the achievement of operational\\n25 metrics, including metrics related to budget controls,\\n26 outage duration and frequency, safety, customerHB0804 - 771 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 service, efficiency and productivity, and\\n2 environmental compliance. Incentive compensation\\n3 expense that is based on net income or an affiliate\\'s\\n4 earnings per share shall not be recoverable under the\\n5 performance-based formula rate;\\n6 (B) recovery of pension and other post-employment\\n7 benefits expense, provided that such costs are\\n8 supported by an actuarial study;\\n9 (C) recovery of severance costs, provided that if\\n10 the amount is over $3,700,000 for a participating\\n11 utility that is a combination utility or $10,000,000\\n12 for a participating utility that serves more than 3\\n13 million retail customers, then the full amount shall\\n14 be amortized consistent with subparagraph (F) of this\\n15 paragraph (4);\\n16 (D) investment return at a rate equal to the\\n17 utility\\'s weighted average cost of long-term debt, on\\n18 the pension assets as, and in the amount, reported in\\n19 Account 186 (or in such other Account or Accounts as\\n20 such asset may subsequently be recorded) of the\\n21 utility\\'s most recently filed FERC Form 1, net of\\n22 deferred tax benefits;\\n23 (E) recovery of the expenses related to the\\n24 Commission proceeding under this subsection (c) to\\n25 approve this performance-based formula rate and\\n26 initial rates or to subsequent proceedings related toHB0804 - 772 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the formula, provided that the recovery shall be\\n2 amortized over a 3-year period; recovery of expenses\\n3 related to the annual Commission proceedings under\\n4 subsection (d) of this Section to review the inputs to\\n5 the performance-based formula rate shall be expensed\\n6 and recovered through the performance-based formula\\n7 rate;\\n8 (F) amortization over a 5-year period of the full\\n9 amount of each charge or credit that exceeds\\n10 $3,700,000 for a participating utility that is a\\n11 combination utility or $10,000,000 for a participating\\n12 utility that serves more than 3 million retail\\n13 customers in the applicable calendar year and that\\n14 relates to a workforce reduction program\\'s severance\\n15 costs, changes in accounting rules, changes in law,\\n16 compliance with any Commission-initiated audit, or a\\n17 single storm or other similar expense, provided that\\n18 any unamortized balance shall be reflected in rate\\n19 base. For purposes of this subparagraph (F), changes\\n20 in law includes any enactment, repeal, or amendment in\\n21 a law, ordinance, rule, regulation, interpretation,\\n22 permit, license, consent, or order, including those\\n23 relating to taxes, accounting, or to environmental\\n24 matters, or in the interpretation or application\\n25 thereof by any governmental authority occurring after\\n26 October 26, 2011 (the effective date of Public ActHB0804 - 773 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 97-616);\\n2 (G) recovery of existing regulatory assets over\\n3 the periods previously authorized by the Commission;\\n4 (H) historical weather normalized billing\\n5 determinants; and\\n6 (I) allocation methods for common costs.\\n7 (5) Provide that if the participating utility\\'s earned\\n8 rate of return on common equity related to the provision\\n9 of delivery services for the prior rate year (calculated\\n10 using costs and capital structure approved by the\\n11 Commission as provided in subparagraph (2) of this\\n12 subsection (c), consistent with this Section, in\\n13 accordance with Commission rules and orders, including,\\n14 but not limited to, adjustments for goodwill, and after\\n15 any Commission-ordered disallowances and taxes) is more\\n16 than 50 basis points higher than the rate of return on\\n17 common equity calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of this\\n18 subsection (c) (after adjusting for any penalties to the\\n19 rate of return on common equity applied pursuant to the\\n20 performance metrics provision of subsection (f) of this\\n21 Section), then the participating utility shall apply a\\n22 credit through the performance-based formula rate that\\n23 reflects an amount equal to the value of that portion of\\n24 the earned rate of return on common equity that is more\\n25 than 50 basis points higher than the rate of return on\\n26 common equity calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of thisHB0804 - 774 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subsection (c) (after adjusting for any penalties to the\\n2 rate of return on common equity applied pursuant to the\\n3 performance metrics provision of subsection (f) of this\\n4 Section) for the prior rate year, adjusted for taxes. If\\n5 the participating utility\\'s earned rate of return on\\n6 common equity related to the provision of delivery\\n7 services for the prior rate year (calculated using costs\\n8 and capital structure approved by the Commission as\\n9 provided in subparagraph (2) of this subsection (c),\\n10 consistent with this Section, in accordance with\\n11 Commission rules and orders, including, but not limited\\n12 to, adjustments for goodwill, and after any\\n13 Commission-ordered disallowances and taxes) is more than\\n14 50 basis points less than the return on common equity\\n15 calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection\\n16 (c) (after adjusting for any penalties to the rate of\\n17 return on common equity applied pursuant to the\\n18 performance metrics provision of subsection (f) of this\\n19 Section), then the participating utility shall apply a\\n20 charge through the performance-based formula rate that\\n21 reflects an amount equal to the value of that portion of\\n22 the earned rate of return on common equity that is more\\n23 than 50 basis points less than the rate of return on common\\n24 equity calculated pursuant to paragraph (3) of this\\n25 subsection (c) (after adjusting for any penalties to the\\n26 rate of return on common equity applied pursuant to theHB0804 - 775 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 performance metrics provision of subsection (f) of this\\n2 Section) for the prior rate year, adjusted for taxes.\\n3 (6) Provide for an annual reconciliation, as described\\n4 in subsection (d) of this Section, with interest, of the\\n5 revenue requirement reflected in rates for each calendar\\n6 year, beginning with the calendar year in which the\\n7 utility files its performance-based formula rate tariff\\n8 pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, with what the\\n9 revenue requirement would have been had the actual cost\\n10 information for the applicable calendar year been\\n11 available at the filing date.\\n12 The utility shall file, together with its tariff, final\\n13 data based on its most recently filed FERC Form 1, plus\\n14 projected plant additions and correspondingly updated\\n15 depreciation reserve and expense for the calendar year in\\n16 which the tariff and data are filed, that shall populate the\\n17 performance-based formula rate and set the initial delivery\\n18 services rates under the formula. For purposes of this\\n19 Section, \"FERC Form 1\" means the Annual Report of Major\\n20 Electric Utilities, Licensees and Others that electric\\n21 utilities are required to file with the Federal Energy\\n22 Regulatory Commission under the Federal Power Act, Sections 3,\\n23 4(a), 304 and 209, modified as necessary to be consistent with\\n24 83 Ill. Admin. Code Part 415 as of May 1, 2011. Nothing in this\\n25 Section is intended to allow costs that are not otherwise\\n26 recoverable to be recoverable by virtue of inclusion in FERCHB0804 - 776 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Form 1.\\n2 After the utility files its proposed performance-based\\n3 formula rate structure and protocols and initial rates, the\\n4 Commission shall initiate a docket to review the filing. The\\n5 Commission shall enter an order approving, or approving as\\n6 modified, the performance-based formula rate, including the\\n7 initial rates, as just and reasonable within 270 days after\\n8 the date on which the tariff was filed, or, if the tariff is\\n9 filed within 14 days after October 26, 2011 (the effective\\n10 date of Public Act 97-616), then by May 31, 2012. Such review\\n11 shall be based on the same evidentiary standards, including,\\n12 but not limited to, those concerning the prudence and\\n13 reasonableness of the costs incurred by the utility, the\\n14 Commission applies in a hearing to review a filing for a\\n15 general increase in rates under Article IX of this Act. The\\n16 initial rates shall take effect within 30 days after the\\n17 Commission\\'s order approving the performance-based formula\\n18 rate tariff.\\n19 Until such time as the Commission approves a different\\n20 rate design and cost allocation pursuant to subsection (e) of\\n21 this Section, rate design and cost allocation across customer\\n22 classes shall be consistent with the Commission\\'s most recent\\n23 order regarding the participating utility\\'s request for a\\n24 general increase in its delivery services rates.\\n25 Subsequent changes to the performance-based formula rate\\n26 structure or protocols shall be made as set forth in SectionHB0804 - 777 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 9-201 of this Act, but nothing in this subsection (c) is\\n2 intended to limit the Commission\\'s authority under Article IX\\n3 and other provisions of this Act to initiate an investigation\\n4 of a participating utility\\'s performance-based formula rate\\n5 tariff, provided that any such changes shall be consistent\\n6 with paragraphs (1) through (6) of this subsection (c). Any\\n7 change ordered by the Commission shall be made at the same time\\n8 new rates take effect following the Commission\\'s next order\\n9 pursuant to subsection (d) of this Section, provided that the\\n10 new rates take effect no less than 30 days after the date on\\n11 which the Commission issues an order adopting the change.\\n12 A participating utility that files a tariff pursuant to\\n13 this subsection (c) must submit a one-time $200,000 filing fee\\n14 at the time the Chief Clerk of the Commission accepts the\\n15 filing, which shall be a recoverable expense.\\n16 In the event the performance-based formula rate is\\n17 terminated, the then current rates shall remain in effect\\n18 until such time as new rates are set pursuant to Article IX of\\n19 this Act, subject to retroactive rate adjustment, with\\n20 interest, to reconcile rates charged with actual costs. At\\n21 such time that the performance-based formula rate is\\n22 terminated, the participating utility\\'s voluntary commitments\\n23 and obligations under subsection (b) of this Section shall\\n24 immediately terminate, except for the utility\\'s obligation to\\n25 pay an amount already owed to the fund for training grants\\n26 pursuant to a Commission order issued under subsection (b) ofHB0804 - 778 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 this Section.\\n2 (d) Subsequent to the Commission\\'s issuance of an order\\n3 approving the utility\\'s performance-based formula rate\\n4 structure and protocols, and initial rates under subsection\\n5 (c) of this Section, the utility shall file, on or before May 1\\n6 of each year, with the Chief Clerk of the Commission its\\n7 updated cost inputs to the performance-based formula rate for\\n8 the applicable rate year and the corresponding new charges.\\n9 Each such filing shall conform to the following requirements\\n10 and include the following information:\\n11 (1) The inputs to the performance-based formula rate\\n12 for the applicable rate year shall be based on final\\n13 historical data reflected in the utility\\'s most recently\\n14 filed annual FERC Form 1 plus projected plant additions\\n15 and correspondingly updated depreciation reserve and\\n16 expense for the calendar year in which the inputs are\\n17 filed. The filing shall also include a reconciliation of\\n18 the revenue requirement that was in effect for the prior\\n19 rate year (as set by the cost inputs for the prior rate\\n20 year) with the actual revenue requirement for the prior\\n21 rate year (determined using a year-end rate base) that\\n22 uses amounts reflected in the applicable FERC Form 1 that\\n23 reports the actual costs for the prior rate year. Any\\n24 over-collection or under-collection indicated by such\\n25 reconciliation shall be reflected as a credit against, or\\n26 recovered as an additional charge to, respectively, withHB0804 - 779 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 interest calculated at a rate equal to the utility\\'s\\n2 weighted average cost of capital approved by the\\n3 Commission for the prior rate year, the charges for the\\n4 applicable rate year. Provided, however, that the first\\n5 such reconciliation shall be for the calendar year in\\n6 which the utility files its performance-based formula rate\\n7 tariff pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section and\\n8 shall reconcile (i) the revenue requirement or\\n9 requirements established by the rate order or orders in\\n10 effect from time to time during such calendar year\\n11 (weighted, as applicable) with (ii) the revenue\\n12 requirement determined using a year-end rate base for that\\n13 calendar year calculated pursuant to the performance-based\\n14 formula rate using (A) actual costs for that year as\\n15 reflected in the applicable FERC Form 1, and (B) for the\\n16 first such reconciliation only, the cost of equity, which\\n17 shall be calculated as the sum of 590 basis points plus the\\n18 average for the applicable calendar year of the monthly\\n19 average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds published by\\n20 the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System in\\n21 its weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successor\\n22 publication. The first such reconciliation is not intended\\n23 to provide for the recovery of costs previously excluded\\n24 from rates based on a prior Commission order finding of\\n25 imprudence or unreasonableness. Each reconciliation shall\\n26 be certified by the participating utility in the sameHB0804 - 780 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 manner that FERC Form 1 is certified. The filing shall\\n2 also include the charge or credit, if any, resulting from\\n3 the calculation required by paragraph (6) of subsection\\n4 (c) of this Section.\\n5 Notwithstanding anything that may be to the contrary,\\n6 the intent of the reconciliation is to ultimately\\n7 reconcile the revenue requirement reflected in rates for\\n8 each calendar year, beginning with the calendar year in\\n9 which the utility files its performance-based formula rate\\n10 tariff pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section, with\\n11 what the revenue requirement determined using a year-end\\n12 rate base for the applicable calendar year would have been\\n13 had the actual cost information for the applicable\\n14 calendar year been available at the filing date.\\n15 (2) The new charges shall take effect beginning on the\\n16 first billing day of the following January billing period\\n17 and remain in effect through the last billing day of the\\n18 next December billing period regardless of whether the\\n19 Commission enters upon a hearing pursuant to this\\n20 subsection (d).\\n21 (3) The filing shall include relevant and necessary\\n22 data and documentation for the applicable rate year that\\n23 is consistent with the Commission\\'s rules applicable to a\\n24 filing for a general increase in rates or any rules\\n25 adopted by the Commission to implement this Section.\\n26 Normalization adjustments shall not be required.HB0804 - 781 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section or Act\\n2 or any rule or other requirement adopted by the\\n3 Commission, a participating utility that is a combination\\n4 utility with more than one rate zone shall not be required\\n5 to file a separate set of such data and documentation for\\n6 each rate zone and may combine such data and documentation\\n7 into a single set of schedules.\\n8 Within 45 days after the utility files its annual update\\n9 of cost inputs to the performance-based formula rate, the\\n10 Commission shall have the authority, either upon complaint or\\n11 its own initiative, but with reasonable notice, to enter upon\\n12 a hearing concerning the prudence and reasonableness of the\\n13 costs incurred by the utility to be recovered during the\\n14 applicable rate year that are reflected in the inputs to the\\n15 performance-based formula rate derived from the utility\\'s FERC\\n16 Form 1. During the course of the hearing, each objection shall\\n17 be stated with particularity and evidence provided in support\\n18 thereof, after which the utility shall have the opportunity to\\n19 rebut the evidence. Discovery shall be allowed consistent with\\n20 the Commission\\'s Rules of Practice, which Rules shall be\\n21 enforced by the Commission or the assigned administrative law\\n22 judge. The Commission shall apply the same evidentiary\\n23 standards, including, but not limited to, those concerning the\\n24 prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred by the\\n25 utility, in the hearing as it would apply in a hearing to\\n26 review a filing for a general increase in rates under ArticleHB0804 - 782 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 IX of this Act. The Commission shall not, however, have the\\n2 authority in a proceeding under this subsection (d) to\\n3 consider or order any changes to the structure or protocols of\\n4 the performance-based formula rate approved pursuant to\\n5 subsection (c) of this Section. In a proceeding under this\\n6 subsection (d), the Commission shall enter its order no later\\n7 than the earlier of 240 days after the utility\\'s filing of its\\n8 annual update of cost inputs to the performance-based formula\\n9 rate or December 31. The Commission\\'s determinations of the\\n10 prudence and reasonableness of the costs incurred for the\\n11 applicable calendar year shall be final upon entry of the\\n12 Commission\\'s order and shall not be subject to reopening,\\n13 reexamination, or collateral attack in any other Commission\\n14 proceeding, case, docket, order, rule or regulation, provided,\\n15 however, that nothing in this subsection (d) shall prohibit a\\n16 party from petitioning the Commission to rehear or appeal to\\n17 the courts the order pursuant to the provisions of this Act.\\n18 In the event the Commission does not, either upon\\n19 complaint or its own initiative, enter upon a hearing within\\n20 45 days after the utility files the annual update of cost\\n21 inputs to its performance-based formula rate, then the costs\\n22 incurred for the applicable calendar year shall be deemed\\n23 prudent and reasonable, and the filed charges shall not be\\n24 subject to reopening, reexamination, or collateral attack in\\n25 any other proceeding, case, docket, order, rule, or\\n26 regulation.HB0804 - 783 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 A participating utility\\'s first filing of the updated cost\\n2 inputs, and any Commission investigation of such inputs\\n3 pursuant to this subsection (d) shall proceed notwithstanding\\n4 the fact that the Commission\\'s investigation under subsection\\n5 (c) of this Section is still pending and notwithstanding any\\n6 other law, order, rule, or Commission practice to the\\n7 contrary.\\n8 (e) Nothing in subsections (c) or (d) of this Section\\n9 shall prohibit the Commission from investigating, or a\\n10 participating utility from filing, revenue-neutral tariff\\n11 changes related to rate design of a performance-based formula\\n12 rate that has been placed into effect for the utility.\\n13 Following approval of a participating utility\\'s\\n14 performance-based formula rate tariff pursuant to subsection\\n15 (c) of this Section, the utility shall make a filing with the\\n16 Commission within one year after the effective date of the\\n17 performance-based formula rate tariff that proposes changes to\\n18 the tariff to incorporate the findings of any final rate\\n19 design orders of the Commission applicable to the\\n20 participating utility and entered subsequent to the\\n21 Commission\\'s approval of the tariff. The Commission shall,\\n22 after notice and hearing, enter its order approving, or\\n23 approving with modification, the proposed changes to the\\n24 performance-based formula rate tariff within 240 days after\\n25 the utility\\'s filing. Following such approval, the utility\\n26 shall make a filing with the Commission during each subsequentHB0804 - 784 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 3-year period that either proposes revenue-neutral tariff\\n2 changes or re-files the existing tariffs without change, which\\n3 shall present the Commission with an opportunity to suspend\\n4 the tariffs and consider revenue-neutral tariff changes\\n5 related to rate design.\\n6 (f) Within 30 days after the filing of a tariff pursuant to\\n7 subsection (c) of this Section, each participating utility\\n8 shall develop and file with the Commission multi-year metrics\\n9 designed to achieve, ratably (i.e., in equal segments) over a\\n10 10-year period, improvement over baseline performance values\\n11 as follows:\\n12 (1) Twenty percent improvement in the System Average\\n13 Interruption Frequency Index, using a baseline of the\\n14 average of the data from 2001 through 2010.\\n15 (2) Fifteen percent improvement in the system Customer\\n16 Average Interruption Duration Index, using a baseline of\\n17 the average of the data from 2001 through 2010.\\n18 (3) For a participating utility other than a\\n19 combination utility, 20% improvement in the System Average\\n20 Interruption Frequency Index for its Southern Region,\\n21 using a baseline of the average of the data from 2001\\n22 through 2010. For purposes of this paragraph (3), Southern\\n23 Region shall have the meaning set forth in the\\n24 participating utility\\'s most recent report filed pursuant\\n25 to Section 16-125 of this Act.\\n26 (3.5) For a participating utility other than aHB0804 - 785 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 combination utility, 20% improvement in the System Average\\n2 Interruption Frequency Index for its Northeastern Region,\\n3 using a baseline of the average of the data from 2001\\n4 through 2010. For purposes of this paragraph (3.5),\\n5 Northeastern Region shall have the meaning set forth in\\n6 the participating utility\\'s most recent report filed\\n7 pursuant to Section 16-125 of this Act.\\n8 (4) Seventy-five percent improvement in the total\\n9 number of customers who exceed the service reliability\\n10 targets as set forth in subparagraphs (A) through (C) of\\n11 paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of 83 Ill. Admin. Code\\n12 Part 411.140 as of May 1, 2011, using 2010 as the baseline\\n13 year.\\n14 (5) Reduction in issuance of estimated electric bills:\\n15 90% improvement for a participating utility other than a\\n16 combination utility, and 56% improvement for a\\n17 participating utility that is a combination utility, using\\n18 a baseline of the average number of estimated bills for\\n19 the years 2008 through 2010.\\n20 (6) Consumption on inactive meters: 90% improvement\\n21 for a participating utility other than a combination\\n22 utility, and 56% improvement for a participating utility\\n23 that is a combination utility, using a baseline of the\\n24 average unbilled kilowatthours for the years 2009 and\\n25 2010.\\n26 (7) Unaccounted for energy: 50% improvement for aHB0804 - 786 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 participating utility other than a combination utility\\n2 using a baseline of the non-technical line loss\\n3 unaccounted for energy kilowatthours for the year 2009.\\n4 (8) Uncollectible expense: reduce uncollectible\\n5 expense by at least $30,000,000 for a participating\\n6 utility other than a combination utility and by at least\\n7 $3,500,000 for a participating utility that is a\\n8 combination utility, using a baseline of the average\\n9 uncollectible expense for the years 2008 through 2010.\\n10 (9) Opportunities for black, indigenous, and people of\\n11 color-owned and women-owned minority-owned and\\n12 female-owned business enterprises: design a performance\\n13 metric regarding the creation of opportunities for black,\\n14 indigenous, and people of color-owned and women-owned\\n15 minority-owned and female-owned business enterprises\\n16 consistent with State and federal law using a base\\n17 performance value of the percentage of the participating\\n18 utility\\'s capital expenditures that were paid to black,\\n19 indigenous, and people of color-owned and women-owned\\n20 minority-owned and female-owned business enterprises in\\n21 2010.\\n22 The definitions set forth in 83 Ill. Admin. Code Part\\n23 411.20 as of May 1, 2011 shall be used for purposes of\\n24 calculating performance under paragraphs (1) through (3.5) of\\n25 this subsection (f), provided, however, that the participating\\n26 utility may exclude up to 9 extreme weather event days fromHB0804 - 787 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 such calculation for each year, and provided further that the\\n2 participating utility shall exclude 9 extreme weather event\\n3 days when calculating each year of the baseline period to the\\n4 extent that there are 9 such days in a given year of the\\n5 baseline period. For purposes of this Section, an extreme\\n6 weather event day is a 24-hour calendar day (beginning at\\n7 12:00 a.m. and ending at 11:59 p.m.) during which any weather\\n8 event (e.g., storm, tornado) caused interruptions for 10,000\\n9 or more of the participating utility\\'s customers for 3 hours\\n10 or more. If there are more than 9 extreme weather event days in\\n11 a year, then the utility may choose no more than 9 extreme\\n12 weather event days to exclude, provided that the same extreme\\n13 weather event days are excluded from each of the calculations\\n14 performed under paragraphs (1) through (3.5) of this\\n15 subsection (f).\\n16 The metrics shall include incremental performance goals\\n17 for each year of the 10-year period, which shall be designed to\\n18 demonstrate that the utility is on track to achieve the\\n19 performance goal in each category at the end of the 10-year\\n20 period. The utility shall elect when the 10-year period shall\\n21 commence for the metrics set forth in subparagraphs (1)\\n22 through (4) and (9) of this subsection (f), provided that it\\n23 begins no later than 14 months following the date on which the\\n24 utility begins investing pursuant to subsection (b) of this\\n25 Section, and when the 10-year period shall commence for the\\n26 metrics set forth in subparagraphs (5) through (8) of thisHB0804 - 788 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subsection (f), provided that it begins no later than 14\\n2 months following the date on which the Commission enters its\\n3 order approving the utility\\'s Advanced Metering Infrastructure\\n4 Deployment Plan pursuant to subsection (c) of Section 16-108.6\\n5 of this Act.\\n6 The metrics and performance goals set forth in\\n7 subparagraphs (5) through (8) of this subsection (f) are based\\n8 on the assumptions that the participating utility may fully\\n9 implement the technology described in subsection (b) of this\\n10 Section, including utilizing the full functionality of such\\n11 technology and that there is no requirement for personal\\n12 on-site notification. If the utility is unable to meet the\\n13 metrics and performance goals set forth in subparagraphs (5)\\n14 through (8) of this subsection (f) for such reasons, and the\\n15 Commission so finds after notice and hearing, then the utility\\n16 shall be excused from compliance, but only to the limited\\n17 extent achievement of the affected metrics and performance\\n18 goals was hindered by the less than full implementation.\\n19 (f-5) The financial penalties applicable to the metrics\\n20 described in subparagraphs (1) through (8) of subsection (f)\\n21 of this Section, as applicable, shall be applied through an\\n22 adjustment to the participating utility\\'s return on equity of\\n23 no more than a total of 30 basis points in each of the first 3\\n24 years, of no more than a total of 34 basis points in each of\\n25 the 3 years thereafter, and of no more than a total of 38 basis\\n26 points in each of the 4 years thereafter, as follows:HB0804 - 789 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (1) With respect to each of the incremental annual\\n2 performance goals established pursuant to paragraph (1) of\\n3 subsection (f) of this Section,\\n4 (A) for each year that a participating utility\\n5 other than a combination utility does not achieve the\\n6 annual goal, the participating utility\\'s return on\\n7 equity shall be reduced as follows: during years 1\\n8 through 3, by 5 basis points; during years 4 through 6,\\n9 by 6 basis points; and during years 7 through 10, by 7\\n10 basis points; and\\n11 (B) for each year that a participating utility\\n12 that is a combination utility does not achieve the\\n13 annual goal, the participating utility\\'s return on\\n14 equity shall be reduced as follows: during years 1\\n15 through 3, by 10 basis points; during years 4 through\\n16 6, by 12 basis points; and during years 7 through 10,\\n17 by 14 basis points.\\n18 (2) With respect to each of the incremental annual\\n19 performance goals established pursuant to paragraph (2) of\\n20 subsection (f) of this Section, for each year that the\\n21 participating utility does not achieve each such goal, the\\n22 participating utility\\'s return on equity shall be reduced\\n23 as follows: during years 1 through 3, by 5 basis points;\\n24 during years 4 through 6, by 6 basis points; and during\\n25 years 7 through 10, by 7 basis points.\\n26 (3) With respect to each of the incremental annualHB0804 - 790 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 performance goals established pursuant to paragraphs (3)\\n2 and (3.5) of subsection (f) of this Section, for each year\\n3 that a participating utility other than a combination\\n4 utility does not achieve both such goals, the\\n5 participating utility\\'s return on equity shall be reduced\\n6 as follows: during years 1 through 3, by 5 basis points;\\n7 during years 4 through 6, by 6 basis points; and during\\n8 years 7 through 10, by 7 basis points.\\n9 (4) With respect to each of the incremental annual\\n10 performance goals established pursuant to paragraph (4) of\\n11 subsection (f) of this Section, for each year that the\\n12 participating utility does not achieve each such goal, the\\n13 participating utility\\'s return on equity shall be reduced\\n14 as follows: during years 1 through 3, by 5 basis points;\\n15 during years 4 through 6, by 6 basis points; and during\\n16 years 7 through 10, by 7 basis points.\\n17 (5) With respect to each of the incremental annual\\n18 performance goals established pursuant to subparagraph (5)\\n19 of subsection (f) of this Section, for each year that the\\n20 participating utility does not achieve at least 95% of\\n21 each such goal, the participating utility\\'s return on\\n22 equity shall be reduced by 5 basis points for each such\\n23 unachieved goal.\\n24 (6) With respect to each of the incremental annual\\n25 performance goals established pursuant to paragraphs (6),\\n26 (7), and (8) of subsection (f) of this Section, asHB0804 - 791 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 applicable, which together measure non-operational\\n2 customer savings and benefits relating to the\\n3 implementation of the Advanced Metering Infrastructure\\n4 Deployment Plan, as defined in Section 16-108.6 of this\\n5 Act, the performance under each such goal shall be\\n6 calculated in terms of the percentage of the goal\\n7 achieved. The percentage of goal achieved for each of the\\n8 goals shall be aggregated, and an average percentage value\\n9 calculated, for each year of the 10-year period. If the\\n10 utility does not achieve an average percentage value in a\\n11 given year of at least 95%, the participating utility\\'s\\n12 return on equity shall be reduced by 5 basis points.\\n13 The financial penalties shall be applied as described in\\n14 this subsection (f-5) for the 12-month period in which the\\n15 deficiency occurred through a separate tariff mechanism, which\\n16 shall be filed by the utility together with its metrics. In the\\n17 event the formula rate tariff established pursuant to\\n18 subsection (c) of this Section terminates, the utility\\'s\\n19 obligations under subsection (f) of this Section and this\\n20 subsection (f-5) shall also terminate, provided, however, that\\n21 the tariff mechanism established pursuant to subsection (f) of\\n22 this Section and this subsection (f-5) shall remain in effect\\n23 until any penalties due and owing at the time of such\\n24 termination are applied.\\n25 The Commission shall, after notice and hearing, enter an\\n26 order within 120 days after the metrics are filed approving,HB0804 - 792 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 or approving with modification, a participating utility\\'s\\n2 tariff or mechanism to satisfy the metrics set forth in\\n3 subsection (f) of this Section. On June 1 of each subsequent\\n4 year, each participating utility shall file a report with the\\n5 Commission that includes, among other things, a description of\\n6 how the participating utility performed under each metric and\\n7 an identification of any extraordinary events that adversely\\n8 impacted the utility\\'s performance. Whenever a participating\\n9 utility does not satisfy the metrics required pursuant to\\n10 subsection (f) of this Section, the Commission shall, after\\n11 notice and hearing, enter an order approving financial\\n12 penalties in accordance with this subsection (f-5). The\\n13 Commission-approved financial penalties shall be applied\\n14 beginning with the next rate year. Nothing in this Section\\n15 shall authorize the Commission to reduce or otherwise obviate\\n16 the imposition of financial penalties for failing to achieve\\n17 one or more of the metrics established pursuant to\\n18 subparagraph (1) through (4) of subsection (f) of this\\n19 Section.\\n20 (g) On or before July 31, 2014, each participating utility\\n21 shall file a report with the Commission that sets forth the\\n22 average annual increase in the average amount paid per\\n23 kilowatthour for residential eligible retail customers,\\n24 exclusive of the effects of energy efficiency programs,\\n25 comparing the 12-month period ending May 31, 2012; the\\n26 12-month period ending May 31, 2013; and the 12-month periodHB0804 - 793 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 ending May 31, 2014. For a participating utility that is a\\n2 combination utility with more than one rate zone, the weighted\\n3 average aggregate increase shall be provided. The report shall\\n4 be filed together with a statement from an independent auditor\\n5 attesting to the accuracy of the report. The cost of the\\n6 independent auditor shall be borne by the participating\\n7 utility and shall not be a recoverable expense. \"The average\\n8 amount paid per kilowatthour\" shall be based on the\\n9 participating utility\\'s tariffed rates actually in effect and\\n10 shall not be calculated using any hypothetical rate or\\n11 adjustments to actual charges (other than as specified for\\n12 energy efficiency) as an input.\\n13 In the event that the average annual increase exceeds 2.5%\\n14 as calculated pursuant to this subsection (g), then Sections\\n15 16-108.5, 16-108.6, 16-108.7, and 16-108.8 of this Act, other\\n16 than this subsection, shall be inoperative as they relate to\\n17 the utility and its service area as of the date of the report\\n18 due to be submitted pursuant to this subsection and the\\n19 utility shall no longer be eligible to annually update the\\n20 performance-based formula rate tariff pursuant to subsection\\n21 (d) of this Section. In such event, the then current rates\\n22 shall remain in effect until such time as new rates are set\\n23 pursuant to Article IX of this Act, subject to retroactive\\n24 adjustment, with interest, to reconcile rates charged with\\n25 actual costs, and the participating utility\\'s voluntary\\n26 commitments and obligations under subsection (b) of thisHB0804 - 794 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Section shall immediately terminate, except for the utility\\'s\\n2 obligation to pay an amount already owed to the fund for\\n3 training grants pursuant to a Commission order issued under\\n4 subsection (b) of this Section.\\n5 In the event that the average annual increase is 2.5% or\\n6 less as calculated pursuant to this subsection (g), then the\\n7 performance-based formula rate shall remain in effect as set\\n8 forth in this Section.\\n9 For purposes of this Section, the amount per kilowatthour\\n10 means the total amount paid for electric service expressed on\\n11 a per kilowatthour basis, and the total amount paid for\\n12 electric service includes without limitation amounts paid for\\n13 supply, transmission, distribution, surcharges, and add-on\\n14 taxes exclusive of any increases in taxes or new taxes imposed\\n15 after October 26, 2011 (the effective date of Public Act\\n16 97-616). For purposes of this Section, \"eligible retail\\n17 customers\" shall have the meaning set forth in Section\\n18 16-111.5 of this Act.\\n19 The fact that this Section becomes inoperative as set\\n20 forth in this subsection shall not be construed to mean that\\n21 the Commission may reexamine or otherwise reopen prudence or\\n22 reasonableness determinations already made.\\n23 (h) By December 31, 2017, the Commission shall prepare and\\n24 file with the General Assembly a report on the infrastructure\\n25 program and the performance-based formula rate. The report\\n26 shall include the change in the average amount perHB0804 - 795 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 kilowatthour paid by residential customers between June 1,\\n2 2011 and May 31, 2017. If the change in the total average rate\\n3 paid exceeds 2.5% compounded annually, the Commission shall\\n4 include in the report an analysis that shows the portion of the\\n5 change due to the delivery services component and the portion\\n6 of the change due to the supply component of the rate. The\\n7 report shall include separate sections for each participating\\n8 utility.\\n9 Sections 16-108.5, 16-108.6, 16-108.7, and 16-108.8 of\\n10 this Act, other than this subsection (h), are inoperative\\n11 after December 31, 2021 2022 for every participating utility\\n12 (except for subsection (g) of Section 16-108.6, which is\\n13 inoperative after December 31, 2022), after which time a\\n14 participating utility shall no longer be eligible to annually\\n15 update the performance-based formula rate tariff pursuant to\\n16 subsection (d) of this Section. At such time, the then current\\n17 rates shall remain in effect until such time as new rates are\\n18 set pursuant to Article IX of this Act, subject to retroactive\\n19 adjustment, with interest, to reconcile rates charged with\\n20 actual costs.\\n21 The fact that this Section becomes inoperative as set\\n22 forth in this subsection shall not be construed to mean that\\n23 the Commission may reexamine or otherwise reopen prudence or\\n24 reasonableness determinations already made.\\n25 (i) While a participating utility may use, develop, and\\n26 maintain broadband systems and the delivery of broadbandHB0804 - 796 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 services, voice-over-internet-protocol services,\\n2 telecommunications services, and cable and video programming\\n3 services for use in providing delivery services and Smart Grid\\n4 functionality or application to its retail customers,\\n5 including, but not limited to, the installation,\\n6 implementation and maintenance of Smart Grid electric system\\n7 upgrades as defined in Section 16-108.6 of this Act, a\\n8 participating utility is prohibited from offering to its\\n9 retail customers broadband services or the delivery of\\n10 broadband services, voice-over-internet-protocol services,\\n11 telecommunications services, or cable or video programming\\n12 services, unless they are part of a service directly related\\n13 to delivery services or Smart Grid functionality or\\n14 applications as defined in Section 16-108.6 of this Act, and\\n15 from recovering the costs of such offerings from retail\\n16 customers.\\n17 (j) Nothing in this Section is intended to legislatively\\n18 overturn the opinion issued in Commonwealth Edison Co. v. Ill.\\n19 Commerce Comm\\'n, Nos. 2-08-0959, 2-08-1037, 2-08-1137,\\n20 1-08-3008, 1-08-3030, 1-08-3054, 1-08-3313 cons. (Ill. App.\\n21 Ct. 2d Dist. Sept. 30, 2010). Public Act 97-616 shall not be\\n22 construed as creating a contract between the General Assembly\\n23 and the participating utility, and shall not establish a\\n24 property right in the participating utility.\\n25 (k) The changes made in subsections (c) and (d) of this\\n26 Section by Public Act 98-15 are intended to be a restatementHB0804 - 797 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 and clarification of existing law, and intended to give\\n2 binding effect to the provisions of House Resolution 1157\\n3 adopted by the House of Representatives of the 97th General\\n4 Assembly and Senate Resolution 821 adopted by the Senate of\\n5 the 97th General Assembly that are reflected in paragraph (3)\\n6 of this subsection. In addition, Public Act 98-15 preempts and\\n7 supersedes any final Commission orders entered in Docket Nos.\\n8 11-0721, 12-0001, 12-0293, and 12-0321 to the extent\\n9 inconsistent with the amendatory language added to subsections\\n10 (c) and (d).\\n11 (1) No earlier than 5 business days after May 22, 2013\\n12 (the effective date of Public Act 98-15), each\\n13 participating utility shall file any tariff changes\\n14 necessary to implement the amendatory language set forth\\n15 in subsections (c) and (d) of this Section by Public Act\\n16 98-15 and a revised revenue requirement under the\\n17 participating utility\\'s performance-based formula rate.\\n18 The Commission shall enter a final order approving such\\n19 tariff changes and revised revenue requirement within 21\\n20 days after the participating utility\\'s filing.\\n21 (2) Notwithstanding anything that may be to the\\n22 contrary, a participating utility may file a tariff to\\n23 retroactively recover its previously unrecovered actual\\n24 costs of delivery service that are no longer subject to\\n25 recovery through a reconciliation adjustment under\\n26 subsection (d) of this Section. This retroactive recoveryHB0804 - 798 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 shall include any derivative adjustments resulting from\\n2 the changes to subsections (c) and (d) of this Section by\\n3 Public Act 98-15. Such tariff shall allow the utility to\\n4 assess, on current customer bills over a period of 12\\n5 monthly billing periods, a charge or credit related to\\n6 those unrecovered costs with interest at the utility\\'s\\n7 weighted average cost of capital during the period in\\n8 which those costs were unrecovered. A participating\\n9 utility may file a tariff that implements a retroactive\\n10 charge or credit as described in this paragraph for\\n11 amounts not otherwise included in the tariff filing\\n12 provided for in paragraph (1) of this subsection (k). The\\n13 Commission shall enter a final order approving such tariff\\n14 within 21 days after the participating utility\\'s filing.\\n15 (3) The tariff changes described in paragraphs (1) and\\n16 (2) of this subsection (k) shall relate only to, and be\\n17 consistent with, the following provisions of Public Act\\n18 98-15: paragraph (2) of subsection (c) regarding year-end\\n19 capital structure, subparagraph (D) of paragraph (4) of\\n20 subsection (c) regarding pension assets, and subsection\\n21 (d) regarding the reconciliation components related to\\n22 year-end rate base and interest calculated at a rate equal\\n23 to the utility\\'s weighted average cost of capital.\\n24 (4) Nothing in this subsection is intended to effect a\\n25 dismissal of or otherwise affect an appeal from any final\\n26 Commission orders entered in Docket Nos. 11-0721, 12-0001,HB0804 - 799 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 12-0293, and 12-0321 other than to the extent of the\\n2 amendatory language contained in subsections (c) and (d)\\n3 of this Section of Public Act 98-15.\\n4 (l) Each participating utility shall be deemed to have\\n5 been in full compliance with all requirements of subsection\\n6 (b) of this Section, subsection (c) of this Section, Section\\n7 16-108.6 of this Act, and all Commission orders entered\\n8 pursuant to Sections 16-108.5 and 16-108.6 of this Act, up to\\n9 and including May 22, 2013 (the effective date of Public Act\\n10 98-15). The Commission shall not undertake any investigation\\n11 of such compliance and no penalty shall be assessed or adverse\\n12 action taken against a participating utility for noncompliance\\n13 with Commission orders associated with subsection (b) of this\\n14 Section, subsection (c) of this Section, and Section 16-108.6\\n15 of this Act prior to such date. Each participating utility\\n16 other than a combination utility shall be permitted, without\\n17 penalty, a period of 12 months after such effective date to\\n18 take actions required to ensure its infrastructure investment\\n19 program is in compliance with subsection (b) of this Section\\n20 and with Section 16-108.6 of this Act. Provided further, the\\n21 following subparagraphs shall apply to a participating utility\\n22 other than a combination utility:\\n23 (A) if the Commission has initiated a proceeding\\n24 pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 16-108.6 of this Act\\n25 that is pending as of May 22, 2013 (the effective date of\\n26 Public Act 98-15), then the order entered in suchHB0804 - 800 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 proceeding shall, after notice and hearing, accelerate the\\n2 commencement of the meter deployment schedule approved in\\n3 the final Commission order on rehearing entered in Docket\\n4 No. 12-0298;\\n5 (B) if the Commission has entered an order pursuant to\\n6 subsection (e) of Section 16-108.6 of this Act prior to\\n7 May 22, 2013 (the effective date of Public Act 98-15) that\\n8 does not accelerate the commencement of the meter\\n9 deployment schedule approved in the final Commission order\\n10 on rehearing entered in Docket No. 12-0298, then the\\n11 utility shall file with the Commission, within 45 days\\n12 after such effective date, a plan for accelerating the\\n13 commencement of the utility\\'s meter deployment schedule\\n14 approved in the final Commission order on rehearing\\n15 entered in Docket No. 12-0298; the Commission shall reopen\\n16 the proceeding in which it entered its order pursuant to\\n17 subsection (e) of Section 16-108.6 of this Act and shall,\\n18 after notice and hearing, enter an amendatory order that\\n19 approves or approves as modified such accelerated plan\\n20 within 90 days after the utility\\'s filing; or\\n21 (C) if the Commission has not initiated a proceeding\\n22 pursuant to subsection (e) of Section 16-108.6 of this Act\\n23 prior to May 22, 2013 (the effective date of Public Act\\n24 98-15), then the utility shall file with the Commission,\\n25 within 45 days after such effective date, a plan for\\n26 accelerating the commencement of the utility\\'s meterHB0804 - 801 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 deployment schedule approved in the final Commission order\\n2 on rehearing entered in Docket No. 12-0298 and the\\n3 Commission shall, after notice and hearing, approve or\\n4 approve as modified such plan within 90 days after the\\n5 utility\\'s filing.\\n6 Any schedule for meter deployment approved by the\\n7 Commission pursuant to this subsection (l) shall take into\\n8 consideration procurement times for meters and other equipment\\n9 and operational issues.

Performance-based ratemaking.\\n6 (a) Findings and Purpose. The General Assembly finds that\\n7 improving the alignment of utility customer and company\\n8 interests is critical to ensuring that Illinois residents and\\n9 businesses have the opportunity to optimize existing utility\\n10 infrastructure and do not suffer economic and environmental\\n11 harm from the State\\'s energy systems. This realignment is\\n12 critical to ensure the ongoing viability of Illinois electric\\n13 utilities, as they face an increasing need to rapidly adopt\\n14 business models and strategies that enable new innovations and\\n15 customer choices. Furthermore, the General Assembly finds that\\n16 this realignment has entered a period of extraordinary\\n17 urgency, given the expected rapid growth of distributed energy\\n18 resources, electric vehicles, and other new technologies that\\n19 substantially change the makeup of the grid. Moreover, urgency\\n20 of action to address increasing threats from climate change\\n21 and to assist communities that have borne a disproportionate\\n22 impact from air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, and\\n23 energy burdens requires immediate and significant change to\\n24 the business model under which utilities in Illinois have\\n25 functioned. Providing incentive for necessary changes throughHB0804 - 805 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 a new holistic, performance-based structure for ratemaking\\n2 will enable alignment of utility, customer, community and\\n3 environmental goals. In particular, the General Assembly finds\\n4 that:\\n5 (1) The traditional regulatory model rewards utilities\\n6 for increasing capital expenditures by basing allowed\\n7 revenues on the value of the rate base, irrespective of\\n8 utility performance. This compact does not align the\\n9 interests of customers and utilities because it may result\\n10 in a bias toward expending utility capital in ways that\\n11 may displace more efficient or cost-effective options,\\n12 such as distributed energy resources owned by customers or\\n13 projects implemented by independent third parties that can\\n14 meet grid needs.\\n15 (2) Traditional regulation also rewards utilities for\\n16 selling higher volumes of electricity through the\\n17 throughput incentive. This model unnecessarily increases\\n18 customer costs and pollution and is therefore in neither\\n19 ratepayers\\' nor the State\\'s interest.\\n20 (3) Though Illinois has taken some measures to move\\n21 utilities to performance-based ratemaking through the\\n22 establishment of performance incentives and a\\n23 performance-based formula rate under the Energy\\n24 Infrastructure Modernization Act, these measures have not\\n25 been transformative in urgently moving electric utilities\\n26 toward the State\\'s ambitious energy policy goals:HB0804 - 806 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 protecting a healthy environment and climate, improving\\n2 public health, and creating quality jobs and economic\\n3 opportunities including wealth building, especially in\\n4 economically disadvantaged communities and BIPOC\\n5 communities. Rather, they have resulted in excess utility\\n6 profits without meaningful improvements in customer\\n7 experience, rates, or equity.\\n8 (4) The General Assembly therefore directs the\\n9 Illinois Commerce Commission to complete a transition to a\\n10 comprehensive performance-based regulation framework for\\n11 electric utilities with more than 500,000 customers. The\\n12 breadth of this framework should remake existing utility\\n13 regulations to position Illinois electric utilities to\\n14 effectively and efficiently achieve current and\\n15 anticipated future energy needs of this State.\\n16 (5) It is the intent of the General Assembly that over\\n17 time the comprehensive performance-based regulation\\n18 framework will progressively reduce the direct link\\n19 between utility revenues and traditional investment levels\\n20 and increasingly tie revenues to performance.\\n21 (b) Definitions.\\n22 As used in this Section:\\n23 \"Commission\" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.\\n24 \"Demand response\" means measures that decrease peak\\n25 electricity demand or shift demand from peak to off-peak\\n26 periods.HB0804 - 807 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 \"Distributed energy resources\" or \"DER\" means a wide range\\n2 of technologies that are located on the customer side of the\\n3 customer\\'s electric meter and can provide value to the\\n4 distribution system, including, but not limited to,\\n5 distributed generation, energy storage, electric vehicles, and\\n6 demand response technologies.\\n7 \"Economically disadvantaged communities\" means areas of\\n8 one or more census tracts where average household income does\\n9 not exceed 80% of area median income.\\n10 \"Environmental justice communities\" means the definition\\n11 of that term based on existing methodologies and findings,\\n12 used and as may be updated by the Illinois Power Agency and its\\n13 Program Administrator in the Illinois Solar for All Program.\\n14 \"Performance-based regulation or ratemaking\" or \"PBR\"\\n15 means a regulatory approach that aligns utility interests with\\n16 customer and societal interests through regulatory mechanisms\\n17 that motivate utilities to improve operations, increase\\n18 program effectiveness, better manage business expenses, and\\n19 align system performance with identified societal or policy\\n20 goals.\\n21 (c) Objectives. The comprehensive PBR framework should be\\n22 designed to accomplish the following objectives:\\n23 (1) incentivize utilities to pursue cost-effective\\n24 solutions to meet customer needs;\\n25 (2) decarbonize utility systems at a pace that meets\\n26 or exceeds state climate goals;HB0804 - 808 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (3) remove utility incentives to grow energy sales,\\n2 except where sales growth is determined to be aligned with\\n3 state policy goals;\\n4 (4) reduce the link between utility expenditures and\\n5 collected revenue and eliminate embedded utility\\n6 preferences for one type of expenditure over another for\\n7 the same service;\\n8 (5) incentivize utilities to undertake the most\\n9 effective expenditures for assets or services, whether\\n10 self-supplied by the utility or through third-party\\n11 contracting, to deliver high-quality service to customers\\n12 at least cost;\\n13 (6) maintain the affordability, safety, and\\n14 reliability of electric power supply; and\\n15 (7) incentivize utilities to pursue equitable access\\n16 to high-quality customer service, affordable rates, DER\\n17 interconnection, and the benefits of grid modernization\\n18 and clean energy for ratepayers in environmental justice\\n19 and economically disadvantaged communities. Additionally,\\n20 motivate utilities to sustain a diverse workforce,\\n21 supplier procurement base and, for relevant programs,\\n22 approved vendor pools.\\n23 (d) The comprehensive PBR framework should comprise a set\\n24 of PBR mechanisms that collectively accomplish the objectives\\n25 set forth in subsection (c). Those mechanisms may include, but\\n26 are not limited to:HB0804 - 809 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (1) multiyear rate plans and associated features, as\\n2 set forth in subsection (e) of this Section;\\n3 (2) revenue decoupling, as set forth in paragraph (11)\\n4 of subsection (e) of this Section;\\n5 (3) shared savings mechanisms;\\n6 (4) performance incentive mechanisms, as set forth in\\n7 subsection (f) of this Section;\\n8 (5) changes to the accounting treatment of capital and\\n9 operating expenditures; and\\n10 (6) changes to rate design, as set forth in Section\\n11 paragraph 10 of subsection (e) of this Section.\\n12 (e) Multi-year Rate Plan.\\n13 (1) If an electric utility has a performance-based\\n14 formula rate in effect under Section 16-108.5 as of\\n15 December 31, 2020, then the utility shall file a petition\\n16 proposing tariffs implementing a four-year Multi-year Rate\\n17 Plan as provided in this Section no later than July 1, 2022\\n18 for delivery service rates to be effective from June 1,\\n19 2023 through May 31, 2027. The Commission shall issue an\\n20 order approving, approving as modified, or rejecting the\\n21 utility\\'s plan no later than June 1, 2023. If the\\n22 Commission rejects the utility\\'s plan, the deadline to\\n23 approve the plan or approve it as modified shall be\\n24 extended to 4 months from the date of the rejection. The\\n25 term \"Multi-year Rate Plan\" refers to a plan establishing\\n26 the rates the utility may charge for each delivery year ofHB0804 - 810 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the four-year period to be covered by the plan. The net\\n2 revenue requirement reflected in rates in effect on\\n3 December 31, 2021 for the electric utility shall remain in\\n4 effect until new rates are approved under the Multi-year\\n5 Rate Plan, and no additional annual reconciliation under\\n6 Section 16-108.5 shall be made.\\n7 (2) A utility proposing a Multi-year Rate Plan shall\\n8 provide a description of the utility\\'s major planned\\n9 investments, which shall include at a minimum all\\n10 investments of $1 million or greater over the plan period.\\n11 Planned investments must conform to the goals established\\n12 in the Multi-year Integrated Grid Plan described in\\n13 section 16-105.17 of this Act.\\n14 (3) The Multi-year Rate Plan shall be implemented\\n15 through a tariff filed with the Commission consistent with\\n16 the provisions of this paragraph (3) that shall apply to\\n17 all delivery service customers. The Commission shall\\n18 initiate and conduct an investigation of the tariff in a\\n19 manner consistent with the provisions of this paragraph\\n20 (3) and the provisions of Article IX of this Act to the\\n21 extent they do not conflict with this paragraph (3). The\\n22 Multi-year Rate Plan approved by the Commission shall do\\n23 the following:\\n24 (A) Provide for the recovery of the utility\\'s\\n25 forecasted rate base, based on a budget forecast or a\\n26 fixed escalation rate, individually or in combination.HB0804 - 811 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 The forecasted rate base must include the utility\\'s\\n2 planned capital investments and investment-related\\n3 costs, including income tax impacts, depreciation, and\\n4 property taxes prudently incurred and reasonable in\\n5 amount consistent with Commission practice and law.\\n6 The budgeting process must be iterative, be rigorous,\\n7 and lead to forecasts that reasonably represent the\\n8 utility\\'s investments during the forecasted period.\\n9 (B) For the first Multi-year Rate Plan, reflect\\n10 year-end capital structure that includes a common\\n11 equity ratio, excluding goodwill, of no more than 50%\\n12 of the total capital structure shall be deemed\\n13 reasonable and prudent and used to set rates.\\n14 (C) For the first Multi-year Rate Plan, include a\\n15 cost of equity, which shall be calculated as the sum of\\n16 the following:\\n17 (i) the average for the applicable calendar\\n18 year of the monthly average yields of 30-year U.S.\\n19 Treasury bonds published by the Board of Governors\\n20 of the Federal Reserve System in its weekly H.15\\n21 Statistical Release or successor publication; and\\n22 (ii) 530 basis points.\\n23 At such time as the Board of Governors of the\\n24 Federal Reserve System ceases to include the monthly\\n25 average yields of 30-year U.S. Treasury bonds in its\\n26 weekly H.15 Statistical Release or successorHB0804 - 812 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 publication, the monthly average yields of the U.S.\\n2 Treasury bonds then having the longest duration\\n3 published by the Board of Governors in its weekly H.15\\n4 Statistical Release or successor publication shall\\n5 instead be used for purposes of this subparagraph (C).\\n6 (D) For subsequent Multi-year Rate Plans, the cost\\n7 of equity and capital structure shall be established\\n8 by the Commission and shall be set to reflect a\\n9 risk-adjusted return compared to the prevailing cost\\n10 of capital and comparable investments in the economy,\\n11 including U.S. Treasury rates, upon which additional\\n12 earning opportunities and penalties can be provided to\\n13 reflect utility performance against identified\\n14 outcomes.\\n15 (E) Recovery of operations and maintenance\\n16 expenses, based on projected costs, an\\n17 electricity-related price index or other formula.\\n18 (F) Amortize the amount of unprotected\\n19 property-related excess accumulated deferred income\\n20 taxes in rates as of December 31, 2022 over a period of\\n21 5 years.\\n22 (G) Disallow recovery of charitable contributions.\\n23 (H) Allow recovery of pension and other\\n24 post-employment benefits expense only if such costs\\n25 are demonstrated to be funded by ratepayers.\\n26 (I) Allow recovery of incentive compensationHB0804 - 813 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 expense that is based on the achievement of\\n2 operational metrics, including metrics related to\\n3 budget controls, outage duration and frequency,\\n4 safety, customer service, efficiency and productivity,\\n5 environmental compliance and attainment of\\n6 environmental goals, and other goals and metrics\\n7 approved by the Commission. Incentive compensation\\n8 expense that is based on net income or an affiliate\\'s\\n9 earnings per share shall not be recoverable;\\n10 (4) Rates charged under the Multi-Year Rate Plan must\\n11 be based only upon the utility\\'s reasonable and prudent\\n12 costs of service over the term of the plan, as determined\\n13 by the Commission, provided that the costs are not being\\n14 recovered elsewhere in rates. Rate adjustments authorized\\n15 by the Commission may continue outside of a plan\\n16 authorized under this Section to the extent such costs are\\n17 not recovered elsewhere in rates. The burden of proof\\n18 shall be on the electric utility to establish the prudence\\n19 of investments and expenditures and to establish that such\\n20 investments are reasonably necessary to meet the\\n21 requirements of the most recently approved Multi-Year\\n22 Integrated Grid Plan described in Section 16-105.17 of\\n23 this Act. The sole fact that a cost differs from that\\n24 incurred in a prior period or that an investment is\\n25 different from that described the Multi-year Integrated\\n26 Grid Plan shall not imply the imprudence orHB0804 - 814 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 unreasonableness of that cost or investment. The sole fact\\n2 that an investment is the same or similar to that\\n3 described in the Multi-Year Integrated Grid Plan shall not\\n4 imply prudence and reasonableness.\\n5 (5) To facilitate public transparency, all materials,\\n6 data, testimony, schedules, etc. shall be provided to the\\n7 Commission in an editable, machine-readable electronic\\n8 format including .doc, .docx, .xls, .xlsx, and similar,\\n9 but not including .pdf or .exif. Should utilities\\n10 designate any materials \"confidential,\" they shall have an\\n11 affirmative duty to explain why the particular information\\n12 is marked confidential. In determining prudence and\\n13 reasonableness of rates, the Commission shall also\\n14 consider each public comment filed in the docket.\\n15 (6) The Commission may, by order, establish terms,\\n16 conditions, and procedures for a Multi-year Rate Plan\\n17 necessary to implement this Section and ensure that rates\\n18 remain just and reasonable during the course of the plan,\\n19 including terms and procedures for rate adjustment. At any\\n20 time prior to conclusion of a Multi-year Rate Plan, the\\n21 Commission, upon its own motion or upon petition of any\\n22 party, may initiate a proceeding to examine the\\n23 reasonableness of the utility\\'s rates under the plan, and\\n24 adjust rates as necessary.\\n25 (7) Capital True-up. The utility shall propose an\\n26 annual capital true-up mechanism that provides a refund toHB0804 - 815 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 customers if the utility\\'s actual capital-related revenue\\n2 requirement is less in total in any of the Multi-Year Rate\\n3 Plan delivery years than the Commission authorizes for\\n4 that year. Conversely, if the Company\\'s actual\\n5 capital-related revenue requirement is more in total in\\n6 the Multi-year Rate Plan delivery year than the Commission\\n7 authorizes for that year, the Company cannot surcharge\\n8 customers to collect any under recovery.\\n9 (8) A participating utility that files a tariff\\n10 pursuant to paragraph (3) of this subsection (e) must\\n11 submit a one-time $200,000 filing fee at the time the\\n12 Chief Clerk of the Commission accepts the filing, which\\n13 shall be a recoverable expense.\\n14 (9) Subsequent Multi-Year Rate Plans. An electric\\n15 utility operating under the Multi-Year Rate Plan shall\\n16 file a new Multi-Year Rate Plan at least 210 days prior to\\n17 the end of the initial Multi-Year Rate Plan, and every 4\\n18 years thereafter, with a rate-effective date of the\\n19 proposed tariffs such that, after the Commission\\n20 suspension period, the rates would take effect immediately\\n21 at the close of the final year of the initial Multi-Year\\n22 Rate Plan. In subsequent Multi-Year Rate Plans, as in the\\n23 initial plans, utilities and stakeholders may propose\\n24 additional metrics that achieve the outcomes described in\\n25 paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of this Section.\\n26 (10) Rate Design. The Commission shall approve tariffsHB0804 - 816 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 as part of each Multi-Year Rate Plan establishing rate\\n2 design for all delivery service customers. These shall\\n3 expand the rate options available to customers, including,\\n4 but not limited to, an affordability rate for low-income\\n5 residential customers, a time-of-use rate, an electric\\n6 vehicle rate, and a peak time savings rate.\\n7 (11) Decoupling. The Commission may, by order, approve\\n8 a tariff filed by an electric utility that provides for\\n9 decoupling of sales and revenues to mitigate the impact on\\n10 public utilities of the energy-savings goals and to reduce\\n11 a utility\\'s disincentive to promote energy efficiency\\n12 under Section 16-111.5B of this Act without adversely\\n13 affecting utility ratepayers. In its consideration of a\\n14 proposed decoupling tariff, the Commission shall consider\\n15 a mechanism that triggers the periodic adjustment to rates\\n16 when the changes in revenue would result in a change\\n17 within a certain percentage, an earnings band to share\\n18 revenues that exceed the authorized return, or other\\n19 mechanisms that reduce the size and frequency of rate\\n20 adjustments.\\n21 (f) Performance Incentive Mechanisms.\\n22 (1) The Commission shall establish performance\\n23 incentive mechanisms in order to better tie utility\\n24 revenues to performance and customer benefits, accelerate\\n25 progress on Illinois energy and other goals, and hold\\n26 utilities publicly accountable. The Commission shallHB0804 - 817 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 develop metrics, which are observable and measurable\\n2 indicators of system or utility performance, in order to\\n3 create performance incentive mechanisms. Specifically, the\\n4 Commission shall establish:\\n5 (A) Tracking metrics, which will be used for\\n6 measuring and reporting utility performance.\\n7 (B) Performance metrics, which will be used for\\n8 financially incentivizing improved utility\\n9 performance.\\n10 (2) Outcomes of Metrics. The Commission shall approve\\n11 tracking and performance metrics that encourage\\n12 cost-effective, equitable utility achievement of the\\n13 following outcomes:\\n14 (A) Affordability. Achieve affordable customer\\n15 energy costs and utility bills, with particular\\n16 emphasis on keeping lower-income households\\' bills\\n17 within a manageable portion of their income.\\n18 (B) Pollution Reduction. Minimize emissions of\\n19 greenhouse gases and pollutants that harm human\\n20 health, particularly in environmental justice and\\n21 economically disadvantaged communities, through both\\n22 (A) minimizing emissions per kilowatt-hour of\\n23 electricity consumed; and (B) minimizing total\\n24 emissions, including by accelerating electrification\\n25 of transportation, buildings and industries where such\\n26 electrification results in net reductions, across allHB0804 - 818 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 fuels and over the life of electrification measures,\\n2 of greenhouse gases and other pollutants.\\n3 (C) Flexibility. Enhance the grid\\'s flexibility to\\n4 adapt to increased deployment of nondispatchable\\n5 resources; improve the ability and performance of the\\n6 grid on load balancing; and address uncertainty around\\n7 future customer needs, future environmental concerns,\\n8 emerging technology, changes in costs of technology\\n9 and service, and other factors.\\n10 (D) Reliability. Meet high standards of overall\\n11 and locational reliability.\\n12 (E) Customer Experience. Deliver customer service\\n13 quality, customer engagement, and customer access to\\n14 utility system information.\\n15 (F) Equity. Maximize and prioritize the allocation\\n16 of grid planning benefits to environmental justice and\\n17 economically disadvantaged customers and communities.\\n18 Sustain a diverse workforce, supplier procurement base\\n19 and, for relevant programs, approved vendor pools.\\n20 (G) Cost-effectiveness. Ensure rates reflect cost\\n21 savings attributable to grid modernization and\\n22 integration of distributed energy resources that allow\\n23 the utility to defer or forgo traditional grid\\n24 investments that would otherwise be required.\\n25 It is the intent of the General Assembly that these\\n26 outcomes shall guide the development of metrics even asHB0804 - 819 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the grid, along with its associated technologies and\\n2 policies, evolves. It is also the intent of the General\\n3 Assembly that the limitation of total costs to customers\\n4 and the promotion of ethical and transparent practices by\\n5 utilities, as well as the role that flexible load and\\n6 distributed energy resources can play in advancing the\\n7 outcomes, be considered in the establishment of metrics.\\n8 (3) Metrics Requirements.\\n9 (A) Tracking Metrics. Tracking metrics shall\\n10 entail a description of the metric, a calculation\\n11 method, and a data collection method. The Commission\\n12 shall approve tracking metrics that measure\\n13 achievement of at least one of the outcomes set forth\\n14 in paragraph (2) and are supported by sufficient\\n15 stakeholder input. Tracking metrics should measure\\n16 outcomes and actual results and projections where\\n17 possible.\\n18 (B) Performance Metrics. Performance metrics shall\\n19 entail a description of the metric, a calculation\\n20 method, a data collection method, annual binding\\n21 performance targets, and monetary incentives (rewards\\n22 or penalties or both, depending on the metric) for\\n23 utilities\\' achievement of or failure to achieve their\\n24 performance targets. The Commission shall approve\\n25 performance metrics that (i) measure achievement of\\n26 the outcomes set forth in paragraph (2); (ii) areHB0804 - 820 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 supported by sufficient stakeholder input; (iii) have\\n2 one year of tracking data collected in a consistent\\n3 manner and verifiable by an independent evaluator in\\n4 order to establish a baseline; and (iv) require an\\n5 incentive (reward or penalty or both) to create\\n6 improved utility performance. While a single\\n7 performance metric may measure achievement of more\\n8 than one of the outcomes set forth in paragraph (2),\\n9 and such metrics should be valued, the Commission\\n10 shall not approve multiple performance metrics that\\n11 measure achievement identical or near-identical\\n12 results. Performance metrics should measure outcomes\\n13 and actual, rather than projected, results where\\n14 possible.\\n15 (C) Performance targets. For metrics where\\n16 progressive improvement is desirable, performance\\n17 targets shall increase annually and shall require\\n18 utilities to perform beyond \"business as usual,\" as\\n19 determined by baseline tracking data and\\n20 high-confidence projections. Increases to a target\\n21 shall be considered in light of other metrics,\\n22 cost-effectiveness, and other factors the Commission\\n23 deems appropriate.\\n24 (D) Performance incentives. The Commission shall\\n25 determine whether and to what extent each performance\\n26 metric shall offer a reward, penalty, or both to aHB0804 - 821 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 utility. For metrics where a reward is offered, and\\n2 that reward is a cash payment, the reward shall be\\n3 calculated as a percentage of net benefits from the\\n4 outcome, net of costs to customers. The Commission\\n5 shall develop a methodology to calculate net benefits\\n6 that includes societal costs and benefits.\\n7 In determining the appropriate level of a reward\\n8 or penalty, the Commission shall consider: the extent\\n9 to which the amount is likely to encourage the utility\\n10 to achieve the performance target in the least cost\\n11 manner; the value of benefits to customers, the grid,\\n12 and the environment from achievement of the\\n13 performance target, including in particular benefits\\n14 to environmental justice and economically\\n15 disadvantaged communities; customer bill\\n16 affordability; the utility\\'s revenue requirement; and\\n17 other such factors that the Commission deems\\n18 appropriate. The consideration of these factors shall\\n19 result in an incentive level that ensures benefits\\n20 exceed costs for customers.\\n21 The rewards or penalties shall be calculated based\\n22 on the electric utility achieving performance targets.\\n23 In determining the specific rewards or penalties, the\\n24 Commission shall give proportionate weight to the\\n25 following set of metrics: affordability,\\n26 cost-effectiveness, pollution reduction, flexibility,HB0804 - 822 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 customer experience, reliability, and equity.\\n2 It is the intent of the General Assembly that over\\n3 time the utility\\'s cost of equity shall be\\n4 progressively reduced while the opportunity to grow\\n5 earnings as a result of achieving performance targets\\n6 shall be progressively increased as the Commission\\n7 establishes new performance metrics.\\n8 (g) Initial Metrics. The Commission shall initiate a\\n9 4-month workshop process no later than March 1, 2022 for the\\n10 purpose of informing the enactment of metrics. The workshop\\n11 shall be facilitated by Staff of the Illinois Commerce\\n12 Commission, and shall be organized and facilitated in a manner\\n13 that encourages representation from diverse stakeholders,\\n14 ensuring equitable opportunities for participation, without\\n15 requiring formal intervention or representation by an\\n16 attorney. Following the workshop, the Commission shall\\n17 establish initial tracking and performance metrics in a\\n18 docketed proceeding that shall be filed by the electric\\n19 utility by July 2, 2022. The initial tracking and performance\\n20 metrics shall be in place for the period of the first\\n21 Multi-Year Rate Plan. The proceeding shall conclude, and the\\n22 commission shall issue an order in the matter, no later than\\n23 April 1, 2023.\\n24 Unless the tracking metrics in subparagraph (3) of\\n25 paragraph (A) and performance metrics in subparagraph (3) of\\n26 paragraph (B) of subsection (f) of this Section are found byHB0804 - 823 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the Commission during initial metric-setting proceeding to not\\n2 meet the requirements set forth in this Section, the\\n3 Commission shall approve these metrics, and it shall establish\\n4 calculations and goals for the tracking metrics set forth in\\n5 subparagraph (3) of paragraph (A) of subsection (f) of this\\n6 Section and calculations, targets, and incentives for the\\n7 tracking metrics set forth in subparagraph (3) of paragraph\\n8 (B) of subsection (f) of this Section. If the Commission finds\\n9 that the metrics set forth in subparagraph (3) of paragraph\\n10 (A) and subparagraph (3) of paragraph (B) of subsection (f) of\\n11 this Section do not meet the requirements set forth in this\\n12 Section, then the Commission shall approve substitute metrics.\\n13 The Commission may also approve additional tracking and\\n14 performance metrics as appropriate if they meet the\\n15 requirements set forth in this Section.\\n16 Initial Performance Metrics shall include at a minimum,\\n17 but not limited to, the following:\\n18 (1) system Average Interruption Frequency Index;\\n19 (2) customer Average Interruption Duration Index; and\\n20 (3) peak load reductions enabled by demand response\\n21 programs.\\n22 (h) Future Metrics. The Commission shall establish new\\n23 tracking and performance metrics in future Annual Performance\\n24 Evaluation proceedings to further measure achievement of the\\n25 outcomes set forth in paragraph (2) of subsection (f) of this\\n26 Section and the other goals and requirements of this Section.HB0804 - 824 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 The Commission shall also evaluate metrics that were\\n2 established in prior Annual Performance Evaluation proceedings\\n3 under the procedures set forth in subsection (i) to determine\\n4 if adjustments are required to improve the likelihood of the\\n5 outcomes described in paragraph (2) of subsection (f). For\\n6 metrics that were established in prior Annual Performance\\n7 Evaluation proceedings and that the Commission elects to\\n8 continue, the design of these metrics, including the goals of\\n9 tracking metrics and the targets and incentive levels and\\n10 structures of performance metrics, may be adjusted pursuant to\\n11 the requirements in this Section. The Commission may also\\n12 phase out tracking and performance metrics that were\\n13 established in prior Annual Performance Evaluation proceedings\\n14 if these metrics no longer meet the requirements of this\\n15 Section or if they are rendered obsolete by the changing needs\\n16 and technology of an evolving grid. Additionally, performance\\n17 metrics that no longer require an incentive to create improved\\n18 utility performance may become tracking metrics.\\n19 In service of the outcomes set forth in paragraph (2) of\\n20 subsection (f), it is the intent of the General Assembly that\\n21 the Commission in future Annual Performance Evaluation\\n22 proceedings establish the tracking metrics and performance\\n23 metrics set forth in subparagraph (A) and subparagraph (B) of\\n24 paragraph (3) of subsection (f) of this Section when these\\n25 metrics would be compliant with the requirements set forth in\\n26 this Section.HB0804 - 825 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (i) Annual Performance Evaluation. On June 1 of each year,\\n2 following the approval of the first Multi-Year Rate Plan and\\n3 its initial delivery year, the Commission shall open an Annual\\n4 Performance Evaluation proceeding to evaluate the utilities\\'\\n5 performance on their metric targets during the delivery year\\n6 just completed and accordingly determine rewards or penalties\\n7 or both to be reflected in rates in the following calendar\\n8 year.\\n9 (1) Utility Reporting. On April 1 of each year, prior\\n10 to the Annual Performance Evaluation proceeding, each\\n11 participating utility shall file a Performance Evaluation\\n12 Report with the Commission that includes a description of\\n13 and all data supporting how the participating utility\\n14 performed under each tracking and performance metric and\\n15 an identification of any extraordinary events that\\n16 adversely impacted the utility\\'s performance. The\\n17 Performance Evaluation Report shall be verified by an\\n18 independent evaluator as set out in paragraph (3) of this\\n19 subsection (i) and shall include both a report made to the\\n20 Commission and a short, public-facing scorecard that makes\\n21 this information publicly accessible and easily\\n22 understandable. The Commission shall post each scorecard\\n23 upon receipt on the Commission\\'s web page in an\\n24 easily-accessible location. The format of the report and\\n25 the scorecard shall be consistent across utilities and\\n26 shall include:HB0804 - 826 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (A) a list of metrics to which the utility is\\n2 subject;\\n3 (B) the previous delivery year\\'s calculation\\n4 methods and performance on metrics if applicable;\\n5 (C) the current delivery year\\'s calculation\\n6 methods and a detailed description of the effect of\\n7 any differences;\\n8 (D) the current-year goals for tracking metrics\\n9 and current-year targets for performance metrics;\\n10 (E) the current year\\'s performance on metrics\\n11 targets;\\n12 (F) a summary of the investments and programs\\n13 undertaken in order to achieve those metrics targets;\\n14 and (G) the annual goals and targets for the remaining\\n15 years of the current Multi-year Rate Plan period.\\n16 Within 30 days after the Commission\\'s Order in the\\n17 utility\\'s Annual Performance Evaluation and Adjustment\\n18 filing, the utility shall update the public scorecard with\\n19 any changes required by the Commission and the revised\\n20 scorecard shall be posted on the Commission\\'s website.\\n21 (2) Public Workshops. Preceding each Annual\\n22 Performance Evaluation, no later than April 1 each year,\\n23 the Commission shall initiate a two-month workshop\\n24 process.

Discrepancies between\\n5 the utility\\'s assumptions, baselines, targets, or\\n6 calculations and those of the independent evaluator shall\\n7 be closely scrutinized by the Commission. If the\\n8 Commission finds that the utility\\'s reported data for any\\n9 metric or metrics significantly deviates from the data\\n10 reported by the independent evaluator, then the Commission\\n11 shall order the utility to revise its data collection and\\n12 calculation process within 60 days, with specifications\\n13 where appropriate.\\n14 (4) Performance Adjustment. The Commission shall,\\n15 after notice and hearing in the Annual Performance\\n16 Evaluation proceeding, enter an order approving the\\n17 utility\\'s performance adjustment based on its achievement\\n18 of or failure to achieve its performance targets no later\\n19 than December 31 each year. The Commission-approved\\n20 penalties or rewards shall be applied beginning with the\\n21 next calendar year. Nothing in this Section shall\\n22 authorize the Commission to reduce or otherwise obviate\\n23 the imposition of financial rewards or penalties for\\n24 achieving or failing to achieve one or more of the\\n25 utility\\'s performance targets.\\n26 (5) Revisions to Metrics. While tracking andHB0804 - 829 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 performance metrics, along with their associated goals,\\n2 targets, and incentives, shall not be changed outside of\\n3 the Annual Performance Evaluation, the Commission may open\\n4 an investigation into the methodology, including\\n5 assumptions and calculations, used to measure or quantify\\n6 progress toward goals and targets in the Annual\\n7 Performance Evaluation at the request of an intervening\\n8 party.\\n9 (220 ILCS 5/16-111.5)\\n10 Sec. 16-111.5.

The procurement administrator shall\\n22 disseminate information to potential bidders to promote a\\n23 procurement event, notify potential bidders that the\\n24 procurement administrator may enter into a post-bid price\\n25 negotiation with bidders that meet the applicable\\n26 benchmarks, provide supply requirements, and otherwiseHB0804 - 848 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 explain the competitive procurement process. In addition\\n2 to such other publication as the procurement administrator\\n3 determines is appropriate, this information shall be\\n4 posted on the Illinois Power Agency\\'s and the Commission\\'s\\n5 websites. The procurement administrator shall also\\n6 administer the prequalification process, including\\n7 evaluation of credit worthiness, compliance with\\n8 procurement rules, and agreement to the standard form\\n9 contract developed pursuant to paragraph (2) of this\\n10 subsection (e). The procurement administrator shall then\\n11 identify and register bidders to participate in the\\n12 procurement event.\\n13 (2) Standard contract forms and credit terms and\\n14 instruments. The procurement administrator, in\\n15 consultation with the utilities, the Commission, and other\\n16 interested parties and subject to Commission oversight,\\n17 shall develop and provide standard contract forms for the\\n18 supplier contracts that meet generally accepted industry\\n19 practices. Standard credit terms and instruments that meet\\n20 generally accepted industry practices shall be similarly\\n21 developed. The procurement administrator shall make\\n22 available to the Commission all written comments it\\n23 receives on the contract forms, credit terms, or\\n24 instruments. If the procurement administrator cannot reach\\n25 agreement with the applicable electric utility as to the\\n26 contract terms and conditions, the procurementHB0804 - 849 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 administrator must notify the Commission of any disputed\\n2 terms and the Commission shall resolve the dispute. The\\n3 terms of the contracts shall not be subject to negotiation\\n4 by winning bidders, and the bidders must agree to the\\n5 terms of the contract in advance so that winning bids are\\n6 selected solely on the basis of price.\\n7 (3) Establishment of a market-based price benchmark.\\n8 As part of the development of the procurement process, the\\n9 procurement administrator, in consultation with the\\n10 Commission staff, Agency staff, and the procurement\\n11 monitor, shall establish benchmarks for evaluating the\\n12 final prices in the contracts for each of the products\\n13 that will be procured through the procurement process. The\\n14 benchmarks shall be based on price data for similar\\n15 products for the same delivery period and same delivery\\n16 hub, or other delivery hubs after adjusting for that\\n17 difference. The price benchmarks may also be adjusted to\\n18 take into account differences between the information\\n19 reflected in the underlying data sources and the specific\\n20 products and procurement process being used to procure\\n21 power for the Illinois utilities. The benchmarks shall be\\n22 confidential but shall be provided to, and will be subject\\n23 to Commission review and approval, prior to a procurement\\n24 event.\\n25 (4) Request for proposals competitive procurement\\n26 process. The procurement administrator shall design andHB0804 - 850 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 issue a request for proposals to supply electricity in\\n2 accordance with each utility\\'s procurement plan, as\\n3 approved by the Commission. The request for proposals\\n4 shall set forth a procedure for sealed, binding commitment\\n5 bidding with pay-as-bid settlement, and provision for\\n6 selection of bids on the basis of price.\\n7 (5) A plan for implementing contingencies in the event\\n8 of supplier default or failure of the procurement process\\n9 to fully meet the expected load requirement due to\\n10 insufficient supplier participation, Commission rejection\\n11 of results, or any other cause.\\n12 (i) Event of supplier default: In the event of\\n13 supplier default, the utility shall review the\\n14 contract of the defaulting supplier to determine if\\n15 the amount of supply is 200 megawatts or greater, and\\n16 if there are more than 60 days remaining of the\\n17 contract term. If both of these conditions are met,\\n18 and the default results in termination of the\\n19 contract, the utility shall immediately notify the\\n20 Illinois Power Agency that a request for proposals\\n21 must be issued to procure replacement power, and the\\n22 procurement administrator shall run an additional\\n23 procurement event. If the contracted supply of the\\n24 defaulting supplier is less than 200 megawatts or\\n25 there are less than 60 days remaining of the contract\\n26 term, the utility shall procure power and energy fromHB0804 - 851 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the applicable regional transmission organization\\n2 market, including ancillary services, capacity, and\\n3 day-ahead or real time energy, or both, for the\\n4 duration of the contract term to replace the\\n5 contracted supply; provided, however, that if a needed\\n6 product is not available through the regional\\n7 transmission organization market it shall be purchased\\n8 from the wholesale market.\\n9 (ii) Failure of the procurement process to fully\\n10 meet the expected load requirement: If the procurement\\n11 process fails to fully meet the expected load\\n12 requirement due to insufficient supplier participation\\n13 or due to a Commission rejection of the procurement\\n14 results, the procurement administrator, the\\n15 procurement monitor, and the Commission staff shall\\n16 meet within 10 days to analyze potential causes of low\\n17 supplier interest or causes for the Commission\\n18 decision. If changes are identified that would likely\\n19 result in increased supplier participation, or that\\n20 would address concerns causing the Commission to\\n21 reject the results of the prior procurement event, the\\n22 procurement administrator may implement those changes\\n23 and rerun the request for proposals process according\\n24 to a schedule determined by those parties and\\n25 consistent with Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power\\n26 Agency Act and this subsection. In any event, a newHB0804 - 852 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 request for proposals process shall be implemented by\\n2 the procurement administrator within 90 days after the\\n3 determination that the procurement process has failed\\n4 to fully meet the expected load requirement.\\n5 (iii) In all cases where there is insufficient\\n6 supply provided under contracts awarded through the\\n7 procurement process to fully meet the electric\\n8 utility\\'s load requirement, the utility shall meet the\\n9 load requirement by procuring power and energy from\\n10 the applicable regional transmission organization\\n11 market, including ancillary services, capacity, and\\n12 day-ahead or real time energy, or both; provided,\\n13 however, that if a needed product is not available\\n14 through the regional transmission organization market\\n15 it shall be purchased from the wholesale market.\\n16 (6) The procurement process described in this\\n17 subsection is exempt from the requirements of the Illinois\\n18 Procurement Code, pursuant to Section 20-10 of that Code.\\n19 (f) Within 2 business days after opening the sealed bids,\\n20 the procurement administrator shall submit a confidential\\n21 report to the Commission. The report shall contain the results\\n22 of the bidding for each of the products along with the\\n23 procurement administrator\\'s recommendation for the acceptance\\n24 and rejection of bids based on the price benchmark criteria\\n25 and other factors observed in the process. The procurement\\n26 monitor also shall submit a confidential report to theHB0804 - 853 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Commission within 2 business days after opening the sealed\\n2 bids. The report shall contain the procurement monitor\\'s\\n3 assessment of bidder behavior in the process as well as an\\n4 assessment of the procurement administrator\\'s compliance with\\n5 the procurement process and rules. The Commission shall review\\n6 the confidential reports submitted by the procurement\\n7 administrator and procurement monitor, and shall accept or\\n8 reject the recommendations of the procurement administrator\\n9 within 2 business days after receipt of the reports.\\n10 (g) Within 3 business days after the Commission decision\\n11 approving the results of a procurement event, the utility\\n12 shall enter into binding contractual arrangements with the\\n13 winning suppliers using the standard form contracts; except\\n14 that the utility shall not be required either directly or\\n15 indirectly to execute the contracts if a tariff that is\\n16 consistent with subsection (l) of this Section has not been\\n17 approved and placed into effect for that utility.\\n18 (h) The names of the successful bidders and the load\\n19 weighted average of the winning bid prices for each contract\\n20 type and for each contract term shall be made available to the\\n21 public at the time of Commission approval of a procurement\\n22 event. The Commission, the procurement monitor, the\\n23 procurement administrator, the Illinois Power Agency, and all\\n24 participants in the procurement process shall maintain the\\n25 confidentiality of all other supplier and bidding information\\n26 in a manner consistent with all applicable laws, rules,HB0804 - 854 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 regulations, and tariffs. Confidential information, including\\n2 the confidential reports submitted by the procurement\\n3 administrator and procurement monitor pursuant to subsection\\n4 (f) of this Section, shall not be made publicly available and\\n5 shall not be discoverable by any party in any proceeding,\\n6 absent a compelling demonstration of need, nor shall those\\n7 reports be admissible in any proceeding other than one for law\\n8 enforcement purposes.\\n9 (i) Within 2 business days after a Commission decision\\n10 approving the results of a procurement event or such other\\n11 date as may be required by the Commission from time to time,\\n12 the utility shall file for informational purposes with the\\n13 Commission its actual or estimated retail supply charges, as\\n14 applicable, by customer supply group reflecting the costs\\n15 associated with the procurement and computed in accordance\\n16 with the tariffs filed pursuant to subsection (l) of this\\n17 Section and approved by the Commission.\\n18 (j) Within 60 days following August 28, 2007 (the\\n19 effective date of Public Act 95-481), each electric utility\\n20 that on December 31, 2005 provided electric service to at\\n21 least 100,000 customers in Illinois shall prepare and file\\n22 with the Commission an initial procurement plan, which shall\\n23 conform in all material respects to the requirements of the\\n24 procurement plan set forth in subsection (b); provided,\\n25 however, that the Illinois Power Agency Act shall not apply to\\n26 the initial procurement plan prepared pursuant to thisHB0804 - 855 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 subsection. The initial procurement plan shall identify the\\n2 portfolio of power and energy products to be procured and\\n3 delivered for the period June 2008 through May 2009, and shall\\n4 identify the proposed procurement administrator, who shall\\n5 have the same experience and expertise as is required of a\\n6 procurement administrator hired pursuant to Section 1-75 of\\n7 the Illinois Power Agency Act. Copies of the procurement plan\\n8 shall be posted and made publicly available on the\\n9 Commission\\'s website. The initial procurement plan may include\\n10 contracts for renewable resources that extend beyond May 2009.\\n11 (i) Within 14 days following filing of the initial\\n12 procurement plan, any person may file a detailed objection\\n13 with the Commission contesting the procurement plan\\n14 submitted by the electric utility. All objections to the\\n15 electric utility\\'s plan shall be specific, supported by\\n16 data or other detailed analyses. The electric utility may\\n17 file a response to any objections to its procurement plan\\n18 within 7 days after the date objections are due to be\\n19 filed. Within 7 days after the date the utility\\'s response\\n20 is due, the Commission shall determine whether a hearing\\n21 is necessary. If it determines that a hearing is\\n22 necessary, it shall require the hearing to be completed\\n23 and issue an order on the procurement plan within 60 days\\n24 after the filing of the procurement plan by the electric\\n25 utility.\\n26 (ii) The order shall approve or modify the procurementHB0804 - 856 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 plan, approve an independent procurement administrator,\\n2 and approve or modify the electric utility\\'s tariffs that\\n3 are proposed with the initial procurement plan. The\\n4 Commission shall approve the procurement plan if the\\n5 Commission determines that it will ensure adequate,\\n6 reliable, affordable, efficient, and environmentally\\n7 sustainable electric service at the lowest total cost over\\n8 time, taking into account any benefits of price stability.\\n9 (k) (Blank).\\n10 (k-5) (Blank).\\n11 (l) An electric utility shall recover its costs incurred\\n12 under this Section, including, but not limited to, the costs\\n13 of procuring power and energy demand-response resources under\\n14 this Section. The utility shall file with the initial\\n15 procurement plan its proposed tariffs through which its costs\\n16 of procuring power that are incurred pursuant to a\\n17 Commission-approved procurement plan and those other costs\\n18 identified in this subsection (l), will be recovered. The\\n19 tariffs shall include a formula rate or charge designed to\\n20 pass through both the costs incurred by the utility in\\n21 procuring a supply of electric power and energy for the\\n22 applicable customer classes with no mark-up or return on the\\n23 price paid by the utility for that supply, plus any just and\\n24 reasonable costs that the utility incurs in arranging and\\n25 providing for the supply of electric power and energy. The\\n26 formula rate or charge shall also contain provisions thatHB0804 - 857 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 ensure that its application does not result in over or under\\n2 recovery due to changes in customer usage and demand patterns,\\n3 and that provide for the correction, on at least an annual\\n4 basis, of any accounting errors that may occur. A utility\\n5 shall recover through the tariff all reasonable costs incurred\\n6 to implement or comply with any procurement plan that is\\n7 developed and put into effect pursuant to Section 1-75 of the\\n8 Illinois Power Agency Act and this Section, including any fees\\n9 assessed by the Illinois Power Agency, costs associated with\\n10 load balancing, and contingency plan costs. The electric\\n11 utility shall also recover its full costs of procuring\\n12 electric supply for which it contracted before the effective\\n13 date of this Section in conjunction with the provision of full\\n14 requirements service under fixed-price bundled service tariffs\\n15 subsequent to December 31, 2006. All such costs shall be\\n16 deemed to have been prudently incurred. The pass-through\\n17 tariffs that are filed and approved pursuant to this Section\\n18 shall not be subject to review under, or in any way limited by,\\n19 Section 16-111(i) of this Act. All of the costs incurred by the\\n20 electric utility associated with the purchase of zero emission\\n21 credits in accordance with subsection (d-5) of Section 1-75 of\\n22 the Illinois Power Agency Act and, beginning June 1, 2017, all\\n23 of the costs incurred by the electric utility associated with\\n24 the purchase of renewable energy resources in accordance with\\n25 Sections 1-56 and 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act, shall\\n26 be recovered through the electric utility\\'s tariffed chargesHB0804 - 858 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 applicable to all of its retail customers, as specified in\\n2 subsection (k) of Section 16-108 of this Act, and shall not be\\n3 recovered through the electric utility\\'s tariffed charges for\\n4 electric power and energy supply to its eligible retail\\n5 customers.\\n6 (m) The Commission has the authority to adopt rules to\\n7 carry out the provisions of this Section. For the public\\n8 interest, safety, and welfare, the Commission also has\\n9 authority to adopt rules to carry out the provisions of this\\n10 Section on an emergency basis immediately following August 28,\\n11 2007 (the effective date of Public Act 95-481).\\n12 (n) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, any\\n13 affiliated electric utilities that submit a single procurement\\n14 plan covering their combined needs may procure for those\\n15 combined needs in conjunction with that plan, and may enter\\n16 jointly into power supply contracts, purchases, and other\\n17 procurement arrangements, and allocate capacity and energy and\\n18 cost responsibility therefor among themselves in proportion to\\n19 their requirements.\\n20 (o) On or before June 1 of each year, the Commission shall\\n21 hold an informal hearing for the purpose of receiving comments\\n22 on the prior year\\'s procurement process and any\\n23 recommendations for change.\\n24 (p) An electric utility subject to this Section may\\n25 propose to invest, lease, own, or operate an electric\\n26 generation facility as part of its procurement plan, providedHB0804 - 859 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 the utility demonstrates that such facility is the least-cost\\n2 option to provide electric service to those retail customers\\n3 included in the plan\\'s electric supply service requirements.\\n4 If the facility is shown to be the least-cost option and is\\n5 included in a procurement plan prepared in accordance with\\n6 Section 1-75 of the Illinois Power Agency Act and this\\n7 Section, then the electric utility shall make a filing\\n8 pursuant to Section 8-406 of this Act, and may request of the\\n9 Commission any statutory relief required thereunder. If the\\n10 Commission grants all of the necessary approvals for the\\n11 proposed facility, such supply shall thereafter be considered\\n12 as a pre-existing contract under subsection (b) of this\\n13 Section. The Commission shall in any order approving a\\n14 proposal under this subsection specify how the utility will\\n15 recover the prudently incurred costs of investing in, leasing,\\n16 owning, or operating such generation facility through just and\\n17 reasonable rates charged to those retail customers included in\\n18 the plan\\'s electric supply service requirements. Cost recovery\\n19 for facilities included in the utility\\'s procurement plan\\n20 pursuant to this subsection shall not be subject to review\\n21 under or in any way limited by the provisions of Section\\n22 16-111(i) of this Act. Nothing in this Section is intended to\\n23 prohibit a utility from filing for a fuel adjustment clause as\\n24 is otherwise permitted under Section 9-220 of this Act.\\n25 (q) If the Illinois Power Agency filed with the\\n26 Commission, under Section 16-111.5 of this Act, its proposedHB0804 - 860 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 procurement plan for the period commencing June 1, 2017, and\\n2 the Commission has not yet entered its final order approving\\n3 the plan on or before the effective date of this amendatory Act\\n4 of the 99th General Assembly, then the Illinois Power Agency\\n5 shall file a notice of withdrawal with the Commission, after\\n6 the effective date of this amendatory Act of the 99th General\\n7 Assembly, to withdraw the proposed procurement of renewable\\n8 energy resources to be approved under the plan, other than the\\n9 procurement of renewable energy credits from distributed\\n10 renewable energy generation devices using funds previously\\n11 collected from electric utilities\\' retail customers that take\\n12 service pursuant to electric utilities\\' hourly pricing tariff\\n13 or tariffs and, for an electric utility that serves less than\\n14 100,000 retail customers in the State, other than the\\n15 procurement of renewable energy credits from distributed\\n16 renewable energy generation devices. Upon receipt of the\\n17 notice, the Commission shall enter an order that approves the\\n18 withdrawal of the proposed procurement of renewable energy\\n19 resources from the plan. The initially proposed procurement of\\n20 renewable energy resources shall not be approved or be the\\n21 subject of any further hearing, investigation, proceeding, or\\n22 order of any kind.\\n23 This amendatory Act of the 99th General Assembly preempts\\n24 and supersedes any order entered by the Commission that\\n25 approved the Illinois Power Agency\\'s procurement plan for the\\n26 period commencing June 1, 2017, to the extent it isHB0804 - 861 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 inconsistent with the provisions of this amendatory Act of the\\n2 99th General Assembly. To the extent any previously entered\\n3 order approved the procurement of renewable energy resources,\\n4 the portion of that order approving the procurement shall be\\n5 void, other than the procurement of renewable energy credits\\n6 from distributed renewable energy generation devices using\\n7 funds previously collected from electric utilities\\' retail\\n8 customers that take service under electric utilities\\' hourly\\n9 pricing tariff or tariffs and, for an electric utility that\\n10 serves less than 100,000 retail customers in the State, other\\n11 than the procurement of renewable energy credits for\\n12 distributed renewable energy generation devices.\\n13 (Source: P.A. 99-906, eff. 6-1-17.)\\n14 (220 ILCS 5/16-111.10 new)\\n15 Sec. 16-111.10. Equitable Energy Upgrade Program.\\n16 (a) The General Assembly finds and declares that Illinois\\n17 homes and businesses can contribute to the creation of a clean\\n18 energy economy, conservation of natural resources, and\\n19 reliability of the electricity grid through the installation\\n20 of cost-effective renewable energy generation, energy\\n21 efficiency, and energy storage systems. Further, a large\\n22 portion of Illinois residents and businesses that would\\n23 benefit from the installation of energy efficiency, storage,\\n24 and renewable energy generation systems are unable to purchase\\n25 systems due to capital or credit barriers. This State shouldHB0804 - 862 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 pursue options to enable many more Illinoisans to access the\\n2 health, environmental, and financial benefits of new clean\\n3 energy technology.\\n4 (b) As used in this Section:\\n5 \"Commission\" means the Illinois Commerce Commission.\\n6 \"Energy project\" means renewable energy generation\\n7 systems, including solar projects, energy efficiency upgrades,\\n8 energy storage systems, or any combination thereof.\\n9 \"The Fund\" means the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund\\n10 established in the Illinois Clean Energy Jobs and Justice Fund\\n11 Act.\\n12 \"Program\" means the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program\\n13 established under subsection (c).\\n14 \"Utility\" means electric utilities providing services\\n15 under this Act.\\n16 (c) The Illinois Commerce Commission shall open an\\n17 investigation into and direct all electric utilities in this\\n18 State to adopt an Equitable Energy Upgrade Program that\\n19 permits customers to finance the construction of energy\\n20 projects through an optional tariff payable directly through\\n21 their utility bill, modeled after the Pay As You Save system,\\n22 developed by the Energy Efficiency Institute. The Program\\n23 model shall enable utilities to offer to make investments in\\n24 energy projects to customer properties with low-cost capital\\n25 and use an opt-in tariff to recover the costs. The Program\\n26 shall be designed to provide customers with immediateHB0804 - 863 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 financial savings if they choose to participate. The Program\\n2 shall allow residential electric utility customers that own\\n3 the property, or renters that have permission of the property\\n4 owner, for which they subscribe to utility service to agree to\\n5 the installation of an energy project. The Program shall\\n6 ensure:\\n7 (1) eligible projects do not require upfront payments;\\n8 however, customers may pay down the costs for projects\\n9 with a payment to the installing contractor in order to\\n10 qualify projects that would otherwise require upfront\\n11 payments;\\n12 (2) eligible projects have sufficient estimated\\n13 savings and estimated lifespan to produce significant,\\n14 immediate net savings;\\n15 (3) participants shall agree the utility can recover\\n16 its costs for the projects at their location by paying for\\n17 the project through an optional tariff directly through\\n18 the participant\\'s electricity bill, allowing participants\\n19 to benefit from installation of energy projects without\\n20 traditional loans; and\\n21 (4) accessibility by lower-income residents and\\n22 environmental justice community residents.\\n23 (d) Program rollout. The Commission shall establish\\n24 Program guidelines with the anticipated schedule of Program\\n25 availability as follows:\\n26 (1) Year 1. Beginning in the first year of operation,HB0804 - 864 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 each utility is required to obtain low-cost capital of at\\n2 least $20,000,000 annually for investments in energy\\n3 projects.\\n4 (2) Year 2. Beginning in the second year of operation,\\n5 each utility is required to obtain low-cost capital for\\n6 investments in energy projects of at least $40,000,000\\n7 annually.\\n8 (3) Year 3. Beginning in the third year of operation,\\n9 each utility is required to obtain low-cost capital for\\n10 investments in as many systems as customers demand,\\n11 subject to available capital provided by the utility,\\n12 State, or other lenders.\\n13 (e) In the design of the Equitable Energy Upgrade Program,\\n14 the Commission shall:\\n15 (1) Within 270 days after the effective date of this\\n16 amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, convene a\\n17 workshop during which interested participants may discuss\\n18 issues and submit comments related to the Program.\\n19 (2) Establish Program guidelines for implementation of\\n20 the Program in accordance with Pay As You Save Essential\\n21 Elements and Minimum Program Requirements that electric\\n22 utilities must abide by when implementing the Program.\\n23 Program guidelines established by the Commission shall\\n24 include the following elements:\\n25 (A) Capital funds. The Commission shall establish\\n26 conditions under which utilities secure capital toHB0804 - 865 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 fund the energy projects. The Commission may allow\\n2 utilities to raise capital independently, work with\\n3 third-party lenders to secure the capital for\\n4 participants, or a combination thereof. Any process\\n5 the Commission approves must use a market mechanism to\\n6 identify the least costly sources of capital funds so\\n7 as to pass on maximum savings to participants. The\\n8 State of Illinois or the Clean Energy Jobs and Justice\\n9 Fund may also choose to provide capital for this\\n10 Program.\\n11 (B) Customer protections. Customer protection\\n12 guidelines should be designed consistent with PAYS\\n13 Essential Elements and Minimum Program Requirements.\\n14 (C) Energy project vendors. The Commission shall\\n15 establish conditions by which utilities may connect\\n16 Program participants to energy project vendors. In\\n17 setting conditions for connection, the Commission may\\n18 prioritize vendors that have a history of good\\n19 relations with the State including vendors that have\\n20 hired participants from State-created job training\\n21 programs.\\n22 (D) Guarantee that conservative estimates of\\n23 financial savings will immediately and significantly\\n24 exceed Program costs for Program participants.\\n25 (f) Within 120 days after the Commission releases the\\n26 Program conditions established under this Section, eachHB0804 - 866 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 utility subject to the requirements of this Section shall\\n2 submit an informational filing to the Commission that\\n3 describes its plan for implementing the provisions of this\\n4 Section. If the Commission finds that the submission does not\\n5 properly comply with the statutory or regulatory requirements\\n6 of the Program, the Commission may require that the utility\\n7 make modifications to its filing.\\n8 (g) An independent process evaluation shall be conducted\\n9 after one year of the Program\\'s operation. An independent\\n10 impact evaluation shall be conducted after 3 years of\\n11 operation, excluding one-time startup costs and results from\\n12 the first 12 months of the Program. The Commission shall\\n13 convene an advisory council of stakeholders, including\\n14 representation of low-income and environmental justice\\n15 community members to make recommendations in response to the\\n16 findings of the independent evaluation.\\n17 (h) The Equitable Energy Upgrade Program shall be designed\\n18 using PAYS system guidelines to be cost-effective for\\n19 customers. Only projects that are deemed to be cost-effective\\n20 and can be reasonably expected to ensure customer savings are\\n21 eligible for funding through the Program, unless, as specified\\n22 in paragraph (1) of subsection (c), customers able to make\\n23 upfront copayments to installers buy down the cost of projects\\n24 so they can be deemed cost-effective.\\n25 (i) Eligible customers must be:\\n26 (1) property renters with permission of the propertyHB0804 - 867 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 owner; or\\n2 (2) property owners.\\n3 (j) Calculation of project cost-effectiveness shall be\\n4 based upon PAYS system requirements.\\n5 (1) The calculation of cost-effectiveness must be\\n6 conducted by an objective process approved by the\\n7 Commission and based on rates in effect at the time of\\n8 installation.\\n9 (2) A project shall be considered cost-effective only\\n10 if it is estimated to produce significant immediate net\\n11 savings, not counting copayments voluntarily made by\\n12 customers. The Commission may establish guidelines by\\n13 which this required savings is estimated.\\n14 (k) The Equitable Energy Upgrade Program should be modeled\\n15 after the Pay As You Save system, by which Program\\n16 participants finance energy projects using the savings that\\n17 the energy project creates with a tariffed on-bill program.\\n18 Eligible projects shall not create personal debt for the\\n19 customer, result in a lien in the event of nonpayment, or\\n20 require customers to pay monthly charges for any upgrade that\\n21 fails and is not repaired within 21 days. The utility may\\n22 restart charges once the upgrade is repaired and functioning\\n23 and extend the term of payments to recover its costs for missed\\n24 payments and deferred cost recovery, providing the upgrade\\n25 continues to function.\\n26 (l) Any energy project that is defective or damaged due toHB0804 - 868 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 no fault of the participant must be either replaced or\\n2 repaired with parts that meet industry standards at the cost\\n3 of the utility or vendor, as specified by the Commission, and\\n4 charges shall be suspended until repairs or replacement is\\n5 completed. The Commission may establish, increase, or replace\\n6 the requirements imposed in this subsection. The Commission\\n7 may determine that this responsibility is best handled by\\n8 participating project vendors in the form of insurance,\\n9 contractual guarantees, or other mechanisms, and issue rules\\n10 detailing this requirement.

and\\n6 (11) (10) these issues, taken together, call for a\\n7 comprehensive review of the impact of these facilities on\\n8 the public health, considering also the energy supply,\\n9 reliability, and costs, the role of renewable forms of\\n10 energy, and the developments in federal law and\\n11 regulations that may affect any state actions, prior to\\n12 making final decisions in Illinois.\\n13 (b) Taking into account the findings and declarations of\\n14 the General Assembly contained in subsection (a) of this\\n15 Section, the Agency shall, within 180 days after the effective\\n16 date of this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly,\\n17 initiate a rulemaking to amend Title 35 of the Illinois\\n18 Administrative Code to establish annual declining greenhouse\\n19 gas pollution caps and caps on co-pollutants, including, but\\n20 not limited to, particulate matter (including both PM and\\n10\\n21 PM ), mercury, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur dioxide, beginning\\n2.5\\n22 in 2023 from all fossil fuel-powered electric generating units\\n23 (including, but not limited to, coal-fired, coal-derived,\\n24 oil-fired, combustion turbine, integrated gasification\\n25 combined cycle, and cogeneration facilities with a nameplate\\n26 capacity that exceeds 25 MW) so as to progressively eliminateHB0804 - 880 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 all emissions of those pollutants from Illinois\\' electric\\n2 sector by the year 2030. No later than one year after receipt\\n3 of the Agency\\'s proposal under this Section, the Board shall\\n4 adopt rules setting out declining annual emissions caps for\\n5 greenhouse gases (CO equivalent) and co-pollutants,\\n2\\n6 including, but not limited to, particulate matter (including\\n7 both PM and PM ), mercury, nitrogen oxides, and sulfur\\n10 2.5\\n8 dioxide, for each individual fossil fuel-powered electric\\n9 generating unit in Illinois as well as aggregate annual\\n10 statewide emissions caps. The Board may set different\\n11 declining caps for each plant, but caps must decline to zero\\n12 emissions for all plants by 2030. As part of its rulemaking\\n13 proposal, the Agency shall:\\n14 (1) ensure that power plants located near densely\\n15 populated and environmental justice communities and those\\n16 with sulfur dioxide emission rates above 0.0007 pounds per\\n17 million Btu are prioritized for more rapid, mandatory,\\n18 plant-specific emissions reductions for both greenhouse\\n19 gases and co-pollutants;\\n20 (2) develop an environmental justice analysis, in\\n21 partnership with the Illinois Commission on Environmental\\n22 Justice and with frontline community feedback, to inform a\\n23 draft rule proposal and identification of power plants of\\n24 particular concern requiring priority emissions\\n25 reductions.

To ensure meaningful involvement in its\\n7 stakeholder process, the agency shall:\\n8 (A) include a formal public comment period with at\\n9 least 4 public hearings located in communities\\n10 geographically dispersed, where fossil fuel-powered\\n11 electric generating units are located;\\n12 (B) ensure full and fair access for working\\n13 residents by providing opportunity for public comment\\n14 outside the workday; and\\n15 (C) issue a responsiveness summary with a draft\\n16 rulemaking briefly describing and responding to, at a\\n17 minimum, all frontline community comments raised\\n18 during the stakeholder process and public comment\\n19 period;\\n20 (4) participate in strategic planning efforts with the\\n21 Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity to\\n22 identify needs and initiatives for communities and workers\\n23 economically impacted by the decline in fossil fuel\\n24 generation;\\n25 (5) evaluate individual units using the criteria above\\n26 and set appropriate annually declining caps for emissionHB0804 - 883 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 reductions, which ultimately result in caps of zero\\n2 emissions from all fossil fuel-powered electric generating\\n3 units by January 1, 2030;\\n4 (6) include provisions to allow owners or operators of\\n5 fossil fuel-powered electric generating units to continue\\n6 operating while using their best efforts to resolve any\\n7 reliability requirements with regional grid operators and\\n8 cease operations as soon as practicable in situations\\n9 where achieving the emission reductions required by the\\n10 Agency\\'s rulemaking proposal necessitates that a\\n11 particular unit cease operations and a regional grid\\n12 operator determines that operation of that unit is\\n13 required to continue to maintain transmission reliability.\\n14 The Agency\\'s rulemaking proposal shall include mechanisms\\n15 designed to limit, to the extent possible, any such\\n16 disruption to the State\\'s emission reduction program,\\n17 including an evaluation of when and how advanced notice of\\n18 intended unit closures should be given to regional grid\\n19 operators; and\\n20 (7) establish emissions caps for (i) individual fossil\\n21 fuel-powered electric generating units and (ii) the entire\\n22 electric sector. The emissions caps shall include all\\n23 emissions, including greenhouse gases and co-pollutants.\\n24 (A) Annual aggregate electric sector emissions\\n25 caps. The aggregate emissions cap shall apply to the\\n26 entire Illinois electric sector and include the sum ofHB0804 - 884 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 emissions from all fossil fuel-powered electric\\n2 generating units. The Agency shall establish a\\n3 schedule through which the aggregate cap shall decline\\n4 annually. A baseline amount shall be calculated by\\n5 averaging the emissions from 2017, 2018, and 2019 of\\n6 plants operating as of the effective date of this\\n7 amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly. To\\n8 ensure consistent progress toward the goal of\\n9 eliminating all emissions from Illinois\\' electric\\n10 sector by 2030, the annual aggregate emissions cap\\n11 shall decrease each year by no less than 7% of the\\n12 baseline amount.\\n13 (B) Annual unit-specific emissions caps. Annual\\n14 emissions caps shall apply to each fossil fuel-powered\\n15 electric generating unit in the State and be\\n16 consistent with achieving the aggregate emissions cap.\\n17 Starting in 2023, the annual emissions cap for each\\n18 plant shall be no greater than the highest emissions\\n19 amount from any of the 3 previous years of operation.\\n20 If a plant first became operational less than 3 years\\n21 before being subject to a unit-specific emissions cap,\\n22 then the annual emissions cap for such a plant shall be\\n23 no greater than its previous year of operation; or if a\\n24 fossil fuel-powered electric generating unit has been\\n25 operational less than one year, then the Agency shall\\n26 set a cap that is consistent with achieving theHB0804 - 885 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 aggregate emissions cap and the goal of eliminating\\n2 all emissions from Illinois\\' electric sector by 2030.\\n3 (C) Annual report. Each year, the Agency shall\\n4 prepare and publish a report on the implementation,\\n5 review, and updating of the schedules regulating\\n6 annual emissions caps as described in this subsection.\\n7 This report shall include:\\n8 (i) an accounting of all greenhouse gas and\\n9 co-pollutant caps on, and actual emissions from,\\n10 individual plants demonstrating the Agency\\'s\\n11 implementation of the requirements in this\\n12 subsection; and\\n13 (ii) an accounting of the aggregate declining\\n14 cap schedules demonstrating the adequacy of the\\n15 schedules to achieve net-zero emissions in the\\n16 electric sector by 2030, and any changes to the\\n17 schedules.\\n18 In addition to the information required under\\n19 items (i) and (ii), the 2025 report shall include a\\n20 review of the Agency\\'s rules regulating annual\\n21 greenhouse gas pollution and co-pollutant caps in\\n22 light of projected emissions for the remaining years\\n23 until 2030 and demonstrate the adequacy of its rules\\n24 and policies to achieve net-zero emissions in the\\n25 electric sector by 2030.

Energy community reinvestment fee.\\n2 (a) As used in this Section:\\n3 \"Carbon dioxide equivalent\" means a unit of measure\\n4 denoting the amount of emissions from a greenhouse gas,\\n5 expressed as the amount of carbon dioxide by weight that\\n6 produces the same global warming impact.\\n7 \"Fossil fuel generating plant\" means an electric\\n8 generating unit or a co-generating unit that produces\\n9 electricity using fossil fuels.\\n10 \"Payment period\" means the three-month period of time\\n11 during which emissions are measured for the purpose of\\n12 quarterly fee calculation.\\n13 (b) The General Assembly finds and declares that:\\n14 (1) the negative effects of fossil fuel-powered\\n15 electric generating units on human health, environmental\\n16 quality, and the climate of our planet require Illinois to\\n17 swiftly retire all such plants and shift to 100% renewable\\n18 energy;\\n19 (2) communities located near fossil fuel-powered\\n20 electric generating units have experienced these health\\n21 and environmental impacts most acutely;\\n22 (3) communities located near fossil fuel-powered\\n23 electric generating units will also experience economic\\n24 challenges as these plants retire;\\n25 (4) the assessment of a fee on the emissions of fossil\\n26 fuel generating plants will lower the exposure ofHB0804 - 891 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 surrounding communities to harmful air pollutants by\\n2 providing incentive for fossil fuel generating plants to\\n3 reduce emissions;\\n4 (5) it is in the public interest that communities\\n5 located near fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants\\n6 should receive support in the form of economic\\n7 reinvestment, as recompense for the negative impacts of\\n8 the operation of fossil fuel-fired electric generating\\n9 plants, to invest in clean energy developments that reduce\\n10 the cumulative impacts of air pollution thus protecting\\n11 the public health, and as a means for creating new\\n12 economic growth and opportunity which is needed when the\\n13 plants retire; and\\n14 (6) this support should be paid for by the owners and\\n15 operators of fossil fuel-fired electric generating plants,\\n16 the operation of which caused harm to the surrounding\\n17 communities.\\n18 (c) Calculation of the Energy Community Reinvestment Fee.\\n19 The Agency shall establish procedures for the collection of\\n20 energy community reinvestment fees. Energy community\\n21 reinvestment fees shall be paid at least quarterly (once every\\n22 3 months) by owners of all fossil fuel generating plants in\\n23 Illinois, based on the share of each plant\\'s contribution to\\n24 the total amount of air pollution emitted by all fossil fuel\\n25 generating plants in that payment period, as determined by the\\n26 Agency and described in this subsection (c).HB0804 - 892 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 (1) Pollution Calculation. The energy community\\n2 reinvestment fee shall be calculated to reflect the\\n3 pollution burden from fossil fuel generating plants, based\\n4 on the total emissions of greenhouse gases. The fee shall\\n5 be calculated based solely on emissions of carbon dioxide,\\n6 methane, and nitrous oxide measured in carbon dioxide\\n7 equivalent tons. The exclusive use of carbon dioxide,\\n8 methane, and nitrous oxide in the calculation of the fee\\n9 is designed to reflect the overall pollution impact from\\n10 each fossil fuel generating plant by using these\\n11 pollutants as a proximate measurement of overall\\n12 emissions.\\n13 (2) Fee Calculation. The Agency shall calculate the\\n14 fee owed by each fossil fuel generating plant owner for\\n15 each payment period by dividing (A) the total emissions of\\n16 carbon dioxide equivalents in tons by each plant as\\n17 described under paragraph (1) of this subsection (c) by\\n18 (B) the total emissions of carbon dioxide equivalents in\\n19 tons of all fossil fuel generating plants subject to the\\n20 energy community reinvestment fee, and multiplying that\\n21 figure by (C) the portion of the annual revenue\\n22 requirements, established in subsection (d) of Section\\n23 20-70 of the Energy Community Reinvestment Act, for that\\n24 payment period.\\n25 (3) Right to Fee Reduction. The owner of each plant\\n26 liable to pay the energy community reinvestment fee shallHB0804 - 893 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 have the right to reduce its liability based on\\n2 electricity production as described in this paragraph (3).\\n3 If requested, the total amount owed each payment period\\n4 for any plant shall be no greater than the total amount of\\n5 kilowatt hours of electricity produced by the plant during\\n6 the payment period multiplied by one cent per kilowatt\\n7 hour, adjusted for inflation from the year this Act takes\\n8 effect. Upon request by a plant owner the Agency shall\\n9 adjust the total amount owed for each payment period by\\n10 the amount necessary to reflect a maximum cost calculated\\n11 based on electricity production.\\n12 (4) Notification by the Agency. The first payment\\n13 period shall begin June 1, 2021. No later than September\\n14 1, 2021, and every 3 months thereafter on the first of the\\n15 month, the Agency shall notify each fossil fuel generating\\n16 plant owner of the fee calculated pursuant to paragraph\\n17 (2) of this subsection (c) for the quarterly period just\\n18 concluded.\\n19 (5) Fee Collection. Plant owners shall remit payment\\n20 of their fee to the Agency within 30 days after the close\\n21 of each payment period, as established by the Agency.\\n22 Funds collected from the energy community reinvestment fee\\n23 shall be deposited into the Energy Community Reinvestment\\n24 Fund.\\n25 (d) Clean Energy Empowerment Zone Task Force involvement.\\n26 If the Agency receives notification from the Department ofHB0804 - 894 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 Commerce and Economic Opportunity that a plant owner has\\n2 failed to engage productively in stakeholder meetings and with\\n3 Clean Energy Empowerment Zone Task Forces, as described in the\\n4 Energy Community Reinvestment Act, an enforcement action may\\n5 be brought under Section 31 of this Act. In addition to any\\n6 other relief that may be obtained as part of the enforcement\\n7 action, the Agency may seek to recover the avoided engagement\\n8 fees. The avoided engagement fees shall be calculated as\\n9 double the amount that is owed by the plant owner under\\n10 subsection (c) for the current payment period, and subsequent\\n11 payment periods, until the Department of Commerce and Economic\\n12 Opportunity sends notification to the Agency that the plant\\n13 owner is in compliance with the stakeholder engagement\\n14 requirements of the Energy Community Reinvestment Act. Avoided\\n15 engagement fees (which, for clarity, are in addition to fees\\n16 collected under subsection (c)) shall be deposited into the\\n17 Energy Community Reinvestment Fund to be directed solely to\\n18 support the local community\\'s own planning efforts and\\n19 investments, and the Agency shall transmit a notification to\\n20 the Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity of the\\n21 amount collected, and the plant owner responsible.\\n22 (e) If a plant owner subject to a fee under this Section\\n23 fails to pay the fee within 90 days after its due date, or\\n24 makes the fee payment from an account with insufficient funds\\n25 to cover the amount of the fee payment, the Agency shall notify\\n26 the plant owner of the failure to pay the fee. If the plantHB0804 - 895 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 owner fails to pay the fee within 60 days after such\\n2 notification, the Agency may, by written notice, immediately\\n3 revoke the air pollution operating permit. Failure of the\\n4 Agency to notify the plant owner of failure to pay a fee due\\n5 under this Section, or the payment of the fee from an account\\n6 with insufficient funds to cover the amount of the fee\\n7 payment, does not excuse or alter the duty of the plant owner\\n8 to comply with the provisions of this Section.\\n9 (f) No later than November 30 of each year, the Agency\\n10 shall submit a report to the Department of Commerce and\\n11 Economic Opportunity describing the amount of fees collected\\n12 from each fossil fuel-powered electric generating unit, the\\n13 status of any delinquencies, and the total amount expected to\\n14 be collected.\\n15 (g) Nothing in this Section shall be interpreted to mean\\n16 that the sum owed by each fossil fuel generating plant due to\\n17 the energy community reinvestment fee is equal to or greater\\n18 than the financial valuation of the total harm created by air\\n19 pollution from each plant.\\n20 (h) Enforcement.\\n21 (1) Any person may file with the Board a complaint,\\n22 following the procedures contained in subsection (d) of\\n23 Section 31 of this Act, against any person, the State of\\n24 Illinois, or any government official for failure to\\n25 perform any act or nondiscretionary duty under this\\n26 Section or for allegedly violating this Section, any ruleHB0804 - 896 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 or regulation adopted under this Section, any permit or\\n2 term or condition of a permit related to this Section, or\\n3 any Board order issued pursuant to this Section. Any\\n4 person shall have standing in an action under this Section\\n5 before the Board. Any person may intervene as a party as a\\n6 matter of right in any legal action concerning this\\n7 Section, whichever the forum, if he or she is or may be\\n8 adversely affected by any failure to perform any act or\\n9 nondiscretionary duty under this Section or any alleged\\n10 violation of this Section, any rule or regulation adopted\\n11 under this Section, any permit or term or condition of a\\n12 permit, or any Board order, by any person, the State of\\n13 Illinois, or any government official. Any person with\\n14 standing to commence an action pursuant to subsection (e)\\n15 of Section 9.10 shall have standing to pursue enforcement\\n16 under this Section.\\n17 (2) In an action brought pursuant to this Section, any\\n18 person may request, and the Board or court may grant,\\n19 injunctive relief, damages (including reasonable attorney\\n20 and expert witness fees), and any other remedy available\\n21 pursuant to Sections 33 or 42 of this Act. The Board or\\n22 court may, if a temporary restraining order or preliminary\\n23 injunction is sought, require the filing of a bond or\\n24 equivalent security in accordance with the Illinois Code\\n25 of Civil Procedure.\\n26 (3) No existing civil or criminal remedy shall beHB0804 - 897 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 excluded or impaired by this Section.\\n2 (415 ILCS 5/9.15 rep.)\\n3 Section 90-50.

That date of expiration of\\n13 the Nuclear Impact Fee permission for each local taxing body\\n14 shall be either exactly 30 years after the effective date of\\n15 this amendatory Act of the 102nd General Assembly, or 10 years\\n16 following the permanent shutdown of the Qualifying Nuclear\\n17 Facility from which the local taxing body collected property\\n18 taxes, whichever date is later.\\n19 (f) In any calendar year, a local taxing body may not\\n20 impose a Nuclear Impact Fee that exceeds 25% of the average\\n21 annual amount of property taxes, or payments in lieu of taxes,\\n22 paid to that local taxing body by the Qualifying Nuclear\\n23 Facility over the most recent 5-year period that the\\n24 Qualifying Nuclear Facility has been operational.\\n25 (g) Any failure by the Qualifying Nuclear Operator to pay\\n26 a Nuclear Impact Fee within 180 days after the fee paymentHB0804 - 899 - LRB102 10881 SPS 16211 b\\n1 deadline shall be deemed a failure to comply, and shall\\n2 automatically require the Qualifying Nuclear Operator to pay\\n3 the Local Entity double the otherwise-allowable property\\n4 taxes, up to 50% of the average annual amount of property taxes\\n5 paid over the most recent 5-year period that the Qualifying\\n6 Nuclear Facility was operational.\\n7 (h) To establish a Nuclear Impact Fee, the local taxing\\n8 body shall adopt a resolution or ordinance describing the\\n9 public need for economic transition, the annual amount of the\\n10 fee, the Qualifying Nuclear Facility, the Qualifying Nuclear\\n11 Operator to be assessed, and a description of projected\\n12 expenses for the fee for the period the fee is in effect. The\\n13 local taxing body shall conduct a public hearing before\\n14 adopting a resolution or ordinance imposing a Nuclear Impact\\n15 Fee permitted under this Section. The hearing shall be held\\n16 within the boundaries of the local taxing body. Public notice\\n17 of the time, place, and purpose of the hearing shall be given\\n18 at least 10 business days before the date of the hearing.\\n19 (i) A local taxing body shall include in its resolution or\\n20 ordinance the method for collection of payment of a Nuclear\\n21 Impact Fee. A county which has adopted a resolution or\\n22 ordinance imposing a Nuclear Impact Fee may collect such Fees\\n23 in the regular property tax bills of the county.
